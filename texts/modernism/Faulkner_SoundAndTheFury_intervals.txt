Through the fence, between the curling flower
spaces, I could see them hitting. They were coming
toward where the flag was and I went along the fence. Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. They
took the flag out, and they were hitting. Then they put
the flag back and they went to the table, and he hit and
the other hit. Then they went on, and I went along the
fence. Luster came away from the flower tree and we
went along the fence and they stopped and we stopped
and I looked through the fence while Luster was hunting
in the grass. "Here, caddie.” He hit. They went away across the pasture.
I held to the fence and watched them going away.
"Listen at you, now.” Luster said. "Aint you something,
thirty-three years old, going on that way. After I done
went all the way to town to buy you that cake. Hush up
that moaning. Aint you going to help me find that quarter
so I can go to the show tonight.”
They were hitting little, across the pasture. I went
along the fence to where the flag was. It flapped on the
bright grass and the trees.
24 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
'"Come on/’ Luster said. “We done looked there. They
aint no more coming right now. Lets go down to the
branch and find that quarter before them niggers finds
it.”It was red, flapping on the pasture. Then there was a
bird slanting and tilting on it. Luster threw. The flag
flapped on the bright grass and the trees. I held to the
fence. “Shut up that moaning.” Luster said. “I cant make
them come if they aint coming, can I. If you dont hush
up, mammy aint going to have no birthday for you. If you dont hush, you know what I going to do. I going to eat that cake all up. Eat them candles, too. Eat all them
thirty-three candles. Come on, lets go down to the
branch. I got to find my quarter. Maybe we can find one
Df they balls. Here. Here they is. Way over yonder. See.” He came to the fence and pointed his aim. “See them.
They aint coming back here no more. Come on.” We went along the fence and came to the garden
fence, where our shadows were. My shadow was higher
than Luster’s on the fence. We came to the broken place
and went through it. “Wait a minute.” Luster said. ‘‘You snagged on that nail
again. Cant you never crawl through here without snagging
on that nail.” Caddy uncaught me and toe crawled through. Uncle
Maury said to not let anybody see us, so we better stoop
over, Caddy said. Stoop over, Benjy. Like this, see. We
stooped over and crossed the garden, where the flowers
rasped and rattled against us. The ground was hard. We
climbed the fence, where the pigs were grunting and
snuffing. I expect they re sorry because one of them got
killed today, Caddy said. The ground was hard, churned
and knotted. Keep your hands in your pockets, Caddy said. Or

'It’s too cold out there/' Versh said. "You dont want tc go out doors.” "What is it now.” Mother said. "He want to go out doors.” Versh said. "Let him go.” Uncle Maury said.
"It's too cold.” Mother said. "He'd better stay in. Benja
min. Stop that, now.”
"It wont hurt him,” Uncle Maury said.
‘"You, Benjamin.” Mother said. "If you dont be good,
you'll have to go to the kitchen.”
""Mammy say keep him out the kitchen today.” Versh
said. "She say she got all that cooking to get done.”
""Let him go, Caroline.” Uncle Maury said. ""You'll woriy
yourself sick over him.”
""I know it.” Mother said. ""It’s a judgment on me. I sometimes wonder.”
""I know, I know.” Uncle Maury said. "Tou must keep
your strength up. I'll make you a toddy.”
""It just upsets me that much more.” Mother said. ""Dont you know it does.”
‘"You'll feel better.” Uncle Maury said. ""Wrap him up
good, boy, and take him out for a while.”
Uncle Maury went away. Versh went away.
"Please hush.” Mother said. "We're trying to get you
out as fast as we can. I dont want you to get sick.” Versh put my overshoes and overcoat on and we took
my cap and went out. Uncle Maury was putting the bottle
away in the sideboard in the dining-room.
"Keep liim out about half an hour, boy.” Uncle Maury
said. ‘'Keep him in the yard, now.”
"Yes, sir.” Versh said. ""We dont never let him get oft the place.”
We went out doors. The sun was cold and bright.

'Where you heading for.” Versh said. “You dont think
you going to town, does you.” We went through the rattling
leaves. The gate was cold. 'Y'ou better keep them
hands in your pockets.” Versh said, 'Tfou get them froze onto that gate, then what you do. Whyn t you wait for them in the house.” He put my hands into my pockets. I could hear him rattling in the leaves. I could smell the
cold. The gate was cold. “Here some hickeynuts. Whooey. Git up that tree. Look
here at this squirl, Benjy.”
I couldn t feel the gate at all, but I could smell the
bright cold. “You better put them hands back in your pockets.”
Caddy was walking. Then she was running, her booksatchel
swinging and jouncing behind her. “Hello, Benjy.” Caddy said. She opened the gate and came in and stooped down. Caddy smelled like leaves. “Did you come to meet me.” she said. “Did you come to
tneet Caddy. What did you let him get his hands so cold
for, Versh.”
“I told him to keep them in his pockets.” Versh said. **Holding onto that ahun gate.”
“Did you come to meet Caddy.” she said, rubbing my
hands. 'What is it. What are you trying to tell Caddy.”
Caddy smelled like trees and like when she says we were
asleep.
What are you moaning about, Luster said. You can
watch them again when we get to the branch. Here.
Here's you a jimson weed. He gave me the flower. We
went through the fence, into the lot. “What is it.” Caddy said. “What are you trying to tell Caddy. Did they send him out, Versh.”
“Couldht keep him in.” Versh said. “He kept on until they let him go and he come right straight down here,
looking through the gate.”

"What is it.” Caddy said. ""Did you think it would be
Christmas when I came home from school. Is that what
you thought. Chidstmas is the day after tomoiTOw. Santy
Claus, Benjy. Santy Claus. Come on, lets run to the
hous"e and get warm.” She took my hand and we ran through the bright rustling leaves. We ran up the steps
and out of the bright cold, into the dark cold. Uncle
Maury was putting the bottle back in the sideboard. He
called Caddy. Caddy said, ""Take him in to the fire, Versh. Go with Versh.” she
said. ""Til come in a minute.”
We went to the fire. Mother said,
""Is he cold, Versh.”
""Nome.” Versh said. ""Take his overcoat and overshoes oflE.” Mother said. '"How many times do I have to tell you not to bring him
into the house with his overshoes on.” ""Yessum.” Versh said. ""Hold still, now.” He took my
overshoes off and unbuttoned my coat. Caddy said,
""Wait, Versh. Cant he go out again. Mother. I want
him to go with me.”
'"You’d better leave him here.” Uncle Maury said. ""He’s been out enough today.”
""I think you’d both better stay in.” Mother said. ""It’s getting colder, Dilsey says,”
""Oh, Mother.” Caddy said. ""Nonsense.” Uncle Maury said. ""She’s been in schooi
all day. She needs the fresh air. Run along, Candace.”
""Let him go. Mother.” Caddy said. ""Please. You know
he’ll cry.”
""Then why did you mention it before him.” Mothe/
said. "Why did you come in here. To give him some ex cuse to worry me again. You’ve been out enough today

"'I know." Mother said. “Nobody knows how I dread
Christmas. Nobody knows. I am not one of those women
who can stand things. I wish for Jasons and the chil- dren's sakes I was stronger."
“You must do the best you can and not let them worry
you." Uncle Maury said. “Run along, you two. But dont
stay out long, now. Your mother will worry."
*Tes, sir." Caddy said. “Come on, Benjy. We're going
out doors again." She buttoned my coat and we went to- ward the door. “Are you going to take that baby out without his overshoes.'"
Mother said. “Do you want to make him sick,
with the house full of company."
“I forgot." Caddy said. “I thought he had them on." We went back. “You must think.” Mother said. Hold
still now Versh said. He put my overshoes on. “Someday
111 be gone, and youll have to think for him." Now stomp
Versh said. “Come here and kiss Mother, Benjamin."
Caddy took me to Mother’s chair and Mother took my
face in her hands and then she held me against her. “My poor baby." she said. She let me go. “You and
Versh take good care of him, honey.”
“Yessum. ' Caddy said. We went out. Caddy said,
"Ton needn't go, Versh. I'll keep him for a while."
All right.” Versh said. “I aint going out in that cold for no fun." He went on and we stopped in the haU and
Caddy knelt and put her arms around me and her cold
blight face against mine. She smelled hke trees. You re not a poor baby. Are you. You’ve got your
Caddy. Haven't you got your Caddy."
Cant you shut up that moaning and slobbering, Luster

We passed the carriage house, where the carriage was. It had a new wheel.
''Git in, now, and set stixl until your maw come/' Dilsey
said. She shoved me into the carriage. T. P. held the
reins. " 'Clare I don't see how come Jason wont get a new
surrey/' Dilsey said. "This thing going to fall to pieces under
you all some day. Look at them wheels."
Mother came out, pulling her veil down. She had some
flowers. "Where's Roskus." she said. "Roskus cant lift his arms, today." Dilsey said. "T. P. can drive all right."
"I'm afraid to." Mother said. "It seems to me you all could furnish me with a driver for the carriage once a week. It’s little enough I ask. Lord knows."
"You know just as well as me that Roskus got the rheumatism
too bad to do more than he have to. Miss Cahline."
Dilsey said. "You come on and get in, no</interval><interval value=1 novelty=0.8634 residual=0.0105 level=normal>w. T. P. can drive you just as good as Roskus."
"Im afraid to/' Mother said. "With the baby.”
Dilsey went up the steps, "You calUng that thing a
baby," she said. She took Mother's arm. "A man big as T. P. Come on, now, if you going."
"I'm afraid to.” Mother said. They came down the
steps and Dilsey helped Mother in. "Perhaps it'll be the
best thing, for all of us." Mother said. "Aint you shamed, talking that way." Dilsey said. "Don’t you know it'll take more than a eighteen year old
nigger to make Queenie run away. She older than him
and Benjy put together. And dont you start no projecking
with Queenie, you hear me, T. P. If you dont drive
to suit Miss Cahline, I going to put Roskus on you. He
aint too tied up to do that.” "Yessum." T. P. said.
30 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
“I just know something will happen.” Mother said. “Stop, Benjamin.”
'‘Give him a flower to hold.” Dilsey said, “That what he
wanting.” She reached her hand in. “No, no.” Mother said. “Youll have them all scattered.” “You hold them.” Dilsey said. “Ill get him one out.” She gave me a flower and her hand went away.
“Go on now, lore Quentin see you and have to go
too.” Dilsey said. “Where is she.” Mother said. “She down to the house playing witli Luster.” Dilsey
said. “Go on, T. P. Drive that surrey like Roskus told you,
now.”
“Yessum.” T. P. said. “Hum up, Queenie.”
“Quentin.” Mother said. “Don't let” “Course I is.” Dilsey said. The carriage jolted and crunched on the drive. “Im
afraid to go and leave Quentin.” Mother said. “Td better not go. T. P.” We went through the gate, where it didnt
jolt anymore. T. P. hit Queenie with the whip.
“You, T. P.” Mother said. “Got to get her going.” T. P. said. “Keep her wake up
till we get back to the barn.”
“Turn around.'^ Mother said. “I m afraid to go and leave
Quentin.”
“Cant turn here.” T. P. said. Then it was broader.
“Cant you turn here.” Mother said. ‘All right.” T. P. said. We began to turn. 'You, T. P.” Mother said, clutching me.
“I got to turn around somehow.” T. P. said. “Whoa,
Queenie.” We stopped.
“You’ll turn us over.” Mother said. “What you want to do, then.” T. P. said.
THE SOIJNB A:ND THE EUBY 3^
‘Tm afraid for you to try to turn around.” Mother said. ‘'Get up, Queenie.” T. P. said. We went on.
"I just know Dilsey will let something happen to Quentin
while I m gone.” Mother said. "We must hurry back.”
"Hum up, there.” T. P. said. He hit Queenie with the
whip.
"You, T. P.” Mother said, clutching me. I could hear
Queenie’s feet and the bright shapes went smooth and
steady on both sides, the shadows of them flowing across Queenie's back. They went on like the bright tops of wheels. Then those on one side stopped at the tall white
post where the soldier was. But on the other side they
went on smooth and steady, but a little slower. "What do you want.” Jason said. He had his hands in
his pockets and a pencil behind his ear. "We re going to the cemetery.” Mother said. "All right.” Jason said. "I dont aim to stop you, do I- Was that all you wanted with me, just to tell me that.” "I know you wont come.” Mother said. "Td feel safer
if you would.”
"Safe from what.” Jason said. "Father and Quentin
cant hurt you.”
Mother put her handkerchief under her veil. '"Stop it, Mother.” Jason said. "Do you want to get that damn
loony to bawhng in the middle of the square. Drive on,
r. p.”
"Hum up, Queenie.” T. P. said.
"it’s a judgment on me.” Mother said. "But I’ll be gone
too, soon.” "Here.” Jason said. ‘Whoa.” T. P. said. Jason said,
"Uncle Maury’s drawing on you for fifty. What do you
want to do about it.”
3^ THE SOUND AND THE EURY
^Why ask me.” Mother said. T dont have any say so. 1 try not to worry you and Dilsey. Ill be gone soon, and
then you”
‘'Go on, T. P.” Jason said. “Hum up Queenie.” T. P. said. The shapes flowed on. The ones on the other side began again, bright and fast and smooth, like when Caddy says we are going to sleep.
Cry hahy. Luster said, Aint you shamed. We went
through the barn. The stalls were all open. You aint got
no spotted pony to ride now. Luster said. The floor was
dry and dusty. The roof was falling. The slanting holes were full of spinning yellow. What do you want to go
that way for. You want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls,
“Keep your hands in your pockets.” Caddy said, “Or
they’ll be froze. You dont want your hands froze on
Christmas, do you.”
We went around the barn. The big cow and the little one were standing in the door, and we could hear Prince
and Queenie and Fancy stomping inside the bam. “If it wasn’t so cold, we’d ride Fancy.” Caddy said, “But it’s too cold to hold on today.” Then we could see the
branch, where the smoke was blowing. “That’s where
they are killing the pig.” Caddy said. “We can come back
by there and see them.” We went down the hill. ‘You want to carry the letter.” Caddy said. ‘You can
carry it.” She took the letter out of her pocket and put it in mine. “It’s a Christmas present.” Caddy said. “Uncle
Maury is going to surprise Mrs Patterson with it. We got
to give it to her without letting anybody see it. Keep
your hands in your pockets good, now.” We came to the
branch.
Its froze. Caddy said, “Look.” She broke the top of
the water and held a piece of it against my face. “Ice.
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 55
That means how cold it is” She helped me across and we
Vv^ent up the hill. ‘"We cant eveti tell Mother and Father.
You know what I think it is. I think it's a surprise for Mother and Father and Mr Patterson both, because Mr
Patterson sent you some candy. Do you remember when
Mr Patterson sent you some candy last summer.”
There was a fence. The vine was dry, and the wind
rattled in it. ‘"Only I dont see why Uncle Maury didn’t send Versh.’' Caddy said. "Versh wont tell.” Mrs Patterson was looking out the window. “You wait here.” Caddy said. “Wait righi
here, now. I’ll be back in a minute. Give me the letter.’^ She took the letter out of my pocket. “Keep your hands
in your pockets.” She climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went through the brown, rattling flowers. Mrs Patterson came to the door and opened it and stood
there. Mr Patterson was chopping in the green flowers. He
stopped chopping and looked at me, Mrs Patterson came
across the garden, running. When 1 saw her eyes 1 began
to cry. You idiot, Mrs Patterson said, I told him never to send you alone again. Give it to me. Quick. Mr Patterson came fast, loith the hoe. Mrs Patterson leaned across the
fence, reaching her hand. She was trying to climb the
fence. Give it to me, she said. Give it to me. Mr Patterson climbed the fence. He took the letter. Mrs Pattersons
dress was caught on the fence. I saw her eyes again and
I ran down the hill. “They aint nothing over yonder but houses.” Luslet
said. “We going down to the branch.”
They were washing down at the branch. One of them was singing. I could smell the clothes flapping, and the
smoke blo^ving across the branch.

"You stay down here/’ Luster said. "You aint got no

"He dont know what he want to do.” Luster said. "He

hall. You sit down here and play with your jimson weed.
Look at them chillen playing in the branch, if you got to look at something. How come you cant behave yourself
like folks.” I sat down on the bank, where they were
washing, and the smoke blowing blue.
"Is you all seen anything of a quarter down here.” Luster
said. 'What quarter.”
“The one I had here this morning.” Luster said. “I lost
it somewhere. It fell through this here hole in my pocket.
If I dont find it I cant go to the show tonight.”
'Where’d you get a quarter, boy. Find it in white folks’ pocket while they aint looking.”
“Got it at the getting place.” Luster said. “Plenty more
where that one come from. Only I got to find that one.
Is you aU found it yet.” “I aint studying no quarter. I got my own business to tend to.” “Come on here.” Luster said. “Help me look for it.” “He wouldn’t know a quarter if he was to see it, would
he.”“He can help look just the same.” Luster said. “You aU
going to the show tonight.”
'Dont talk to me about no show. Time I get done over

"Aint nobody going make you go to that show.”
"Aint yet. Aint thought of it, I reckon.”
"What you got against white folks.” "Aint got nothing against them. I goes my way and lets white folks go theirs. I aint studying that show.”
"Got a man in it can play a tune on a saw. Play it hke

"You go last night.” Luster said. "1 going tonight. If I can find where I lost that quarter.”
"You going take him with you, I reckon.”
"Me.” Luster said. ""You reckon I be found anywhere
with him, time he start bellering.”
""What does you do when he start bellering.”
""1 whips him.” Luster said. He sat down and rolled up
his overalls. They played in the branch.
""You all found any balls yet.” Luster said.
""Aint you talking biggity. I bet you better not let your
grandmammy hear you talking like that.” Luster got into the branch, where they were playing.
He hxmted in the water, along the bank.
""I had it when we was down here this morning.” Luster
said. "Where *bouts you lose it.” ""Right out this here hole in my pocket,” Luster said. They hunted in the branch. Then they all stood up quick
and stopped, then they splashed and fought in the
branch. Luster got it and they squatted in the water,
looking up the hill through the bushes.
"Where is they.” Luster said.

Luster put it in his pocket. They came down the hill. ''Did a ball come down here.”
"It ought to be in the water. Didn't any of you boys see
it or hear it.” "Aint heard nothing come down here.” Luster said. “Heard something hit that tree up yonder. Dont know
which way it went.”
They looked in the branch.
"Hell. Look along the branch. It came down here. I saw it.” They looked along the branch. Then they went back
up the hill. "Have you got that ball.” the boy said. "What I want with it.” Luster said. "I aint seen no ball.” The boy got in the water. He went on. He turned and
looked at Luster again. He went on down the branch.
The man said "Caddie” up the hill. The boy got out of the water and went up the hill. "Now, just listen at you.” Luster said. "Hush up,”
"What he moaning about now.”
"Lawd knows.” Luster said. "He just starts Hke that. He been at it aU morning. Cause it his birthday, I reckon.”
"How old he.” “He thirty-three.” Luster said. "Thirty-three this morning.”
"You mean, he been three years old thirty years.”
"I going by what mammy say.” Luster said. "I dont

and rolled up my trousers. "Now, git in that water and
play and see can you stop that slobbering and moaning.”
I hushed and got in the water and Roskus came and
said to come to supper and Caddy said,
Ifs not supper time yet. Tm not going.
She was wet. We were playing in the branch and
Caddy squatted down and got her dress wet and Versh
said,
"Your mommer going to whip you for getting your
dress wet.”
"She’s not going to do any such thing.” Caddy said. "How do you know.” Quentin said. "That’s all right how I know.” Caddy said. "How do
you know.”
"She said she was.” Quentin said. "Besides, I’m older than you.”
"I’m seven years old.” Caddy said, "I guess I know.”
"I’m older than that.” Quentin said. "I go to school. Dont I, Versh.”
"I’m going to school next year.” Caddy said, "When it comes. Aint I, Versh.”
"You know she whip you when you get your dress wet.” Versh said.
"It’s not wet.” Caddy said. She stood up in the water
and looked at her dress. 'TU take it ofiE.” she said. "Then
it’ll dry.”
"I bet you wont.” Quentin said.
"I bet I will.” Caddy said. "I bet you better not.” Quentin said. Caddy came to Versh and me and turned her bade,
"Unbutton it, Versh.” she said.

‘‘Dont you do it, Versh/' Quentiu said.
'""Taint none of my dress/" Versh said. ""You unbutton it, Versh/" Caddy said, ""Or I’ll tell Dil- sey what you did yesterday/" So Versh unbuttoned it. ""You just take your dress oflE."" Quentin said. Caddy
took her dress oflF and thi*ew it on the bank. Then she
didn"t have on anything but her bodice and drawers, and
Quentin slapped her and she slipped and fell down in the water. When she got up she began to splash water on
Quentin, and Quentin splashed water on Caddy. Some of
it splashed on Versh and me and Versh picked me up
and put me on the bank. He said he was going to tell on Caddy and Quentin, and then Quentin and Caddy began
to splash water at Versh. He got behind a bush.
""Tm going to tell mammy on you all."" Versh said. Quentin climbed up on the bank and tried to catch
Versh, but Versh ran away and Quentin couldn’t. When
Quentin came back Versh stopped and hollered that he was going to tell. Caddy told him that if he wouldn’t teU,
they’d let him come back. So Versh said he wouldn’t, and
they let him.
""Now I guess you’re satisfied/" Quentin said, ""We’ll both get whipped now.”
""I dont care.” Caddy said. ""I’U run away.”
""Yes you wiU.” Quentin said. "TU run away and never come back.” Caddy said. I began
to cry. Caddy turned around and said ""Hush.” So I hushed. Then they played in the branch. Jason was playing
too. He was by himself further down the branch.
Versh came around the busk and lifted me down into the
water again, Caddy was all wet and muddy behind, and
I started to cry and she came and squatted in the water. ""Hush now/" she said. ""I’m not going to run away.” So
I hushed. Caddv smelled lilce trees in the rain.

What is the matter with you, Luster said. Cant you get
done with that moaning and play in the branch like folks, Whynt you take him on home, Didnt they told you
not to take him off the place.
He still think they own this pasture. Luster said. Cant
nobody see down here from the house, noways.
We can. And folks dont like to look at a loony. Taint no luck in it, Roskus came and said to come to supper and Caddy
said it wasn’t supper time yet. "‘Yes tis.” Roskus said. ‘'Dilsey say for you all to come
on to the house. Bring them on, Versh.” He went up the
hill, where the cow was lowing.
"Maybe well be dry by the time we get to the house/‘
Quentin said. "It was all your fault.” Caddy said. "I hope we do get
whipped.” She put her dress on and Versh buttoned it. "They wont know you got wet.” Versh said. "It dont
show on you. Less me and Jason tells.” "Are you going to teU, Jason.” Caddy said. "Tell on who.” Jason said. "He wont tell.” Quentin said. "Will you, Jason.”
"I bet he does teU.” Caddy said. "Hell tell Damuddy ” "He cant tell her.” Quentin said. "She’s sick. If we walk
slow itll be too dark for them to see.” "I dont care whether they see or not.” Caddy said. "I’m
going to tell, myself. You carry him up the hill, Versh.”
"Jason wont tell.” Quentin said. "You remember that bow and arrow I made you, Jason.”
"It’s broke now.” Jason said. "Let him tell.” Caddy said. "I dont give a cuss. Carry

See you all at the show tonight, Luster said. Come on,

‘If we go slow, ifll be dark when we get there.” Quentin said. ‘Tm not going slow.” Caddy said. We went up the hill, but Quentin didn’t come. He was down at the branch
when we got to where we could smell the pigs. They
were grunting and snuflSng in the trough in the corner. Jason came behind us, with his hands in his pockets. Roskus
was milking the cow in the barn door. The cows came jumping out of the barn. “Go on.” T. P. said. “Holler again. I going to holler myself.
Whooey.” Quentin kicked T. P. again. He kicked
T. P. into the trough where the pigs ate and T. P. lay
there. “Hot dog.” T. P. said, “Didn’t he get me then. You
see that while man kick me that time. Whooey.”
I wasn’t crying, but I couldn’t stop. I wasn’t crying, but

ground kept slopi’^g up and the cows ran up the hill T. P. tried to get up. Pie fell down again and the cows ran down the hill. Quentin held my arm and we went toward
the barn. Then the barn wasn’t there and we had to wait
until it came back. I didn’t see it come back. It came behind
us and Quentin set me down in the trough where
the cows ate. I held on to it. It was going away too, r.jad I held to it. The cows ran down the hill again, across the
door. I couldn’t stop. Quentin and T. P came up the hill, fighting. T. P. was falling down the hill and Quentin
dragged him up the hill. Quentin hit X. P. I couldn’t stop.
“Stand up.” Quentin said, ‘You stay right here. Dont
you go away until I get back.”
“Me and Benjy going back to the wedding.” T. P. said. ^Whooey.”
Quentin hit T. P. again. Then he began to thump T. P.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 4^
against the wail. T. P. was laughing. Every time Quentin
thumped him against the wall he tried to say Whooeyj
but he couldn't say it for laughing. I quit crying, but I couldn’t stop. T. P. fell on me and the bam door went
away. It went down the hill and T. P. was fighting by
himself and he fell down again. He was still laughing,
and I couldn’t stop, and I tried to get up and I fell down,
and I couldn’t stop. Versh said, '"You sho done it now. I’ll declare if you aint. Shut up
that yelhng.”
T. P. was still laughing. He flopped on the door and
laughed. 'Whooey.” he said, '‘Me and Benjy going back
to the wedding. Sassprilluh.” T. P. said. "Hush.” Versh said. "Where you get it.” "Out the cellar.” T. P. said. "Whooey.”
"Hush up.” Versh said, "Where’bouts in the cellar.” "Anywhere.” T. P. said. He laughed some more. "Moren
a hundred bottles left. Moren a million. Look out, nigger,
I going to holler.” Quentin said, "Lift him up.”
Versh lifted me up. "Drink this, Benjy.” Quentin said. The glass was hot. "Hush, now.” Quentin said. "Drink it.” "Sassprilluh,” T. P. said. "Lemme drink it, Mr Quentin.”
"You shut your mouth.” Versh said, "Mr Quentin wear you out.” "Hold him, Versh.” Quentin said. They held me. It was hot on my chin and on my shirt, ‘TDrink.” Quentin said. They held my head. It was hot in- side me, and I began again. It was crying now, and some
thing was happening inside me and I cried more, and
they held me until it stopped happening. Then I hushed.
It was still going around, and then the shapes began.
"Open the crib, Versh.” They were going slow. "Spread

those empty sacks on the floor/' They were going faster,
almost fast enough, "Now. Pick up his feet." They went
on, smooth and bright. I could hear T. P. laughing. I went on with them, up the bright hill. At the top of the hill Versh put me down. "Come on
here, Quentin." he called, looking back down the hill. Quentin was still standing there by the branch. He was
chunking into the shadows where the branch was. "Let the old skizzard stay there." Caddy said. She took
my hand and we went on past the bam and tlirough the
gate. There was a frog on the brick walk, squatting in die middle of it. Caddy stepped over it and pulled me
on."Come on, Maury</interval><interval value=3 novelty=0.8193 residual=-0.0319 level=normal>." she said. It still squatted there until Jason poked at it with his toe. "Hell make a wart on you." Versh said. The frog
hopped away.
"Come on, Maury." Caddy said. "They got company tonight." Versh said. "How do you know." Caddy said. "With all them hghts on." Versh said, "Light in every
window.”
"I reckon we can turn all the lights on without company,
if we want to." Caddy said.
"I bet it's company." Versh said. "You all better go in
the back and slip upstairs."
"I dont care." Caddy said. "I'll walk right in the parlor
where they are." "I bet your pappy whip you if you do." Versh said. "I dont care." Caddy said. "I'U walk right in the parlor,
m walk right in the dining room and eat supper,"
"Where you sit." Versh said. "Td sit in Damuddy's chair.'^ Caddy said. "She eats in
bed."
THE SOUND AND THE FUKY 43
"Tm hungry.” Jason said. He passed us and ran on up
the walk. He had his hands in his pockets and he fell down. Versh went and picked him up.
"If you keep them hands out your pockets, you could
stay on your feet.” Versh said. ""You cant never get them
out in time to catch yourseK, fat as you is.” Father was standing by the kitchen steps. ""Where’s Quentin.” he said. ""He coming up the walk.” Versh said. Quentin was
coming slow. His shirt was a white blur.
""Oh.” Father said. Light fell down the steps, on him.
""Caddy and Quentin threw water on each other.” Ja- son said. We waited.
""They did.” Father said. Quentin came, and Father
said, ""You can eat supper in the Idtchen tonight.” He
stopped and took me up, and the light came tumbling
down the steps on me too, and I could look down at Caddy and Jason and Quentin and Versh. Father turned
toward the steps. ""You must be quiet, though.” he said. ""Why must we be quiet, Father.” Caddy said. ""Have we got company.”
""Yes.” Father said.
""I told you they was company.” Versh said. ""You did not.” Caddy said, ""I was the one that said there was. I said I would”
""Hush.” Father said. They hushed and Father opened
the door and we crossed the back porch and went in to the kitchen. Dilsey was there, and Father put me in the
chair and closed the apron down and pushed it to the
table, where supper was. It was steaming up.
""You mind Dilsey, now.” Father said. ""Dont let them
make any more noise than they can help, Dilsey.”
""Yes, sir.” Dilsey said. Father went away.
44 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
“Remember to mind Dilsey, now/' lie said behind us.
I leaned my face over where the supper was. it steamed
up on my face. “Let them mind me tonight, Father.” Caddy said, “I wont.” Jason said. “Im going to mind Dilsey.”
“Youll have to, if Father says so.” Caddy said. “Let
them mind me, Father.”
“I wont.” Jason said, “I wont mind you.”
“Hush.” Father said. “You all mind Caddy, then. When
they are done, bring them up the back stairs, Dilsey.”
“Yes, sir.” Dilsey said. “There.” Caddy said, “Now I guess youll mind me.”
“You all hush, now.” Dilsey said. “You got to be quiet
tonight.”
"Why do we have to be quiet tonight.” Caddy whispered.
“Never you mind.” Dilsey said, “Youll know in the
Lawd's own time,” She brought my bowl. The steam
from it came and tickled my face. “Come here, Versh.”
Dilsey said. ""When is the Lawd's own time, Dilsey.” Caddy said.
“It’s Sunday.” Quentin said. ""Dont you know anything.”
""Shhhhhh.” Dilsey said. ""Didn't Mr Jason say for you
all to be quiet. Eat your supper, now. Here, Versh. Git
his spoon.” Versh's hand came with the spoon, into the
bowl. The spoon came up to my mouth. The steam tick- led into my moutli. Then we quit eating and we looked
at each other and we were quiet, and then we heard it again and I began to cry. ""What was that.” Caddy said. She put her hand on my hand.
""That was Mother.” Quentin said. The spoon came up
and I ate, then I cried again.
""Hush.” Caddy said. But I didn't hush and she came
THE SOUI^D AND THE EURY 45
and put her arms around me. Dilsey went and closed
both the doors and then we couldn’t hear it. “Hush, now.” Caddy said. I hushed and ate. Quentin
wasn’t eating, but Jason was. “That was Mother.” Quentin said. He got up.
“You set right down.” Dilsey said. “They got company
in there, and you in them muddy clothes. You set down
too, Caddy, and get done eating.”
“She was crying.” Quentin said.
“It was somebody singing.” Caddy said. 'Wasn’t it, Dilsey/’
“You all eat your supper, now, like Mr Jason said.” Dil- sey said. “You’ll know in the Lawd’s own time.” Caddy
went back to her chair. “I told you it was a party.” she said. Versh said, “He done et all that.” “Bring his bowl here.” Dilsey said. The bowl wen^
away.
“Dilsey.” Caddy said, “Quentin s not eating his supper. Hasn’t he got to mind me.”
“Eat your supper, Quentin.” Dilsey said, “You all got
to get done and get out of my kitchen.”
“I dont want any more supper.” Quentin said. “You’ve got to eat if I say you have.” Caddy said. “Hasn’t he, Dilsey.”
The bowl steamed up to my face, and Versh’s hand
dipped the spoon in it and the steam tickled into my
mouth.
“I dont want any more.” Quentin said. “How can they
have a party when Damuddy’s sick.” “They’ll have it down stairs.” Caddy said. “She can come to the landing and see it. That’s what I’m going to do when I get my nightie on.”
i6 THE SOUND AND THE FUKY
‘"Mother was crying ” Quentin said. "Wasn’t she crying,
Dilsey.”
“Dont you come pestering at me, boy.” Dilsey said, "1 got to get supper for all them folks soon as you all get
done eating,”
After a while even Jason was through eating, and he
began to cry. “Now you got to tune up.” Dilsey said. “He does it every night since Damuddy was sick and
he cant sleep with her.” Caddy said. “Cry baby.”
“I’m going to tell on you.” Jason said. He was crying. “You’ve already told.” Caddy said. “There’s not anything else you can tell, now.”
“You all needs to go to bed.” Dilsey said. She came and
lifted me down and wiped my face and hands with a warm cloth. “Versh, can you get them up the back stairs quiet You, Jason, shut up that crying.”
“It’s too early to go to bed now.” Caddy said. “We
dont ever have to go to bed this early.”
‘Tou is tonight.” Dilsey said, “Your pa say for you to come right on up stairs when you et supper. You heard
him.”
“He said to mind me.” Caddy said. “I’m not going to mind you.” Jason said. “You have to.” Caddy said. “Come on, now. You have
to do like I say.”
“Make them be quiet, Versh.” Dilsey said. “You all going
to be quiet, ain’t you.”
“What do we have to be so quiet for, tonight.” Caddy
said. "Tour mommer aint feehng well.” Dilsey said. “You all go on with Versh, now.”
“I told you Mother was crying.” Quentin said. Versh
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 47
took me up and opened the door onto the back porch*
We went out and Versh closed the door back. I could
smell Versh and feel him. “You all be quiet, now. We're
not going up stairs yet. Mr. Jason said for you to come
right up stairs. He said to mind me. Tm not going to mind you. But he said for all of us to. Didn't he, Quentin."
I could feel Versh's head. I could hear us. “Didn't
he, Versh. Yes, that's right. Then I say for us to go out doors a while. Come on." Versh opened the door and we
went out. We went down the steps. “I expect we'd better go down to Versh's house, so we'll be quiet." Caddy said. Versh put me down and Caddy
took my hand and we went down tire brick walk.
“Come on.” Caddy said, “That frog's gone. He’s
hopped way over to the garden, by now. Maybe we'll see another one.” Roskus came with the milk buckets. He
went on. Quentin wasn't coming with us. He was sitting on the kitchen steps. We went down to Versh's house. I liked to smell Versh's house. There was a fire in it and
T. P. squatting in his shirt tail in front of it, chunking it into a blaze. Then I got up and T. P. dressed me and we went to the kitchen and ate. Dilsey was singing and I began to cry and she stopped.
“Keep him away from the house, now.” Dilsey said. ‘We cant go that way.” T. P. said. We played in the branch.
‘We cant go around yonder.” T. P. said. “Dont you
know mammy say we cant.” Dilsey was singing in the kitchen and I began to cry. “Hush.” T. P. said. “Come on. Lets go down to the
barn.”
48 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
Roskus was milking at the barn. He was milking with one hand, and groaning. Some birds sat on the bam door
and watched him. One of them came down and ate with
the cows. I watched Roskus milk while T. P. was feeding
Queenie and Prince. The calf was in the pig pen. It nuzzled
at the wire, bawhng.
"T. P.” Roskus said. T. P. said Sir, in the barn. Fancy
held her head over the door, because T. P. hadn t fed her
yet. '"Git done there.” Roskus said. "You got to do this milking. I cant use my right hand no more.”
T. P. came and milked.
"Whyn t you get the doctor.” T. P. said. "Doctor cant do no good.” Roskus said. "Not on this place.”
"What wrong with this place.” T. P. said. "Taint no luck on this place.” Roskus said. "Turn that
calf in if you done.”
Taint no luck on this place, Roskus said. The fire rose and fell behind him and Versh, sliding on his and VersKs
face. Dilsey finished putting me to bed. The bed smelled
like T. P. I liked it, "What you know about it.” Dilsey said. "What trance you been in.” "Dont need no trance.” Roskus said. "Aint the sign of it laying right there on that bed. Aint the sign of it been
here for folks to see fifteen years now.”
"Spose it is.” Dilsey said. "It aint hurt none of you and
youm, is it. Versh working and Frony married off your
hands and T. P. getting big enough to take your place
when rheumatism finish getting you.”
"They been two, now.” Roskus said. "Going to be one

"I heard a squinch owl that night.” T. P. said. "Dan

"Going to be more than one more.” Dilsey said. "Show

going to set up with him while he cries.” "They aint no luck on this place.” Roskus said. "I seen
it at first but when they changed his name I knowed it.” "Hush your mouth.” Dilsey said. She pulled the covers up. It smelled like T. P. 'Tfou aU shut up now, till he get
to sleep.”
"I seen the sign.” Roskus said. “Sign T. P. got to do all your work for you.” Dilsey
said. Take him and Quentin down to the home and let them play with Lmter, where Frony can watch them,
T. P., and go and help your pa. We finished eating. T. P. took Quentin up and we went
down to T. P.’s house. Luster was playing in the dirt. T. P. put Quentin down and she played in the dirt too. Luster had some spools and he and Quentin fought and
Quentin had the spools. Luster cried and Frony came
and gave Luster a tin can to play with, and then I had
the spools and Quentin fought me and I cried. "Hush.” Frony said, "Aint you shamed of yourself. Taking
a baby’s play pretty.” She took the spools from me
and gave them back to Quentin.
"Hush, now.” Frony said, "Hush, I tell you.”
"Hush up.” Frony said. "You needs whipping, that’s what you needs.” She took Luster and Quentin up.
"Come on here.” she said. We went to the bam. T. P. was
milking the cow. Roskus was sitting on the box.
"What’s the matter with him now.” Roskus said.
50 THE SOUND AND THE FUUY
'TTou have to keep him down here.” Frony said. '‘He Bghting these babies again. Taking they play things. Stay
here with T. P. now, and see can you hush a while.”
"Clean that udder good now.” Roskus said. "You milked
that young cow dry last winter. If you milk titiis one dry,
they aint going to be no more milk.” Dilsey was singing.
"Not around yonder.” T. P. said. "Dont you know
mammy say you cant go around there.” They were singing.
"Come on.” T. P. said. "Lets go play with Quentin and
Luster. Come on.” Quentin and Luster were playing in the dirt in front of T. P.’s house. There was a fire in the house, rising and
Jailing, with Roskus sitting black against it. "That’s three, thank the Lawd.” Roskus said. "I told you two years ago. They aint no luck on this place.”
"Whyn’t you get out, then.” Dilsey said. She was undressing
me. "Your bad luck talk got them Memphis notions
into Versh. That ought to satisfy you.”
"If that all the bad luck Versh have.” Roskus said,
Frony came in. "You all done.” Dilsey said. "T. P. fimshing up.” Frony said. "Miss Cahline want
you to put Quentin to bed.”
"I’m coming just as fast as I can.” Dilsey said. "She
ought to know by this time I aint got no wings.”
"That’s what I tell you.” Roskus said. "They aint no
luck going be on no place where one of they own chillens’ name aint never spoke.”
"Hush.” Dilsey said. "Do you want to get him started” "Raising a child not to know its own mammy’s name.”
Roskus said. "Dont you bother your head about her.” Dilsey said.

'1 raised all of them and I reckon I can raise one more. Hush now. Let him get to sleep if he will.’’ ‘'Saying a name.” Frony said. “He dont know nobody’s
name.”
“You just say it and see if he dont.” Dilsey said. ‘Tou
say it to him while he sleeping and I bet he hear you.”
“He know lot more than folks thinks.” Roslcus said. “He
knowed they time was coming, like that pointer done.
He could tell you when hisn coming, if he could talk. Or
yours. Or mine.”
“You take Luster outen that bed, mammy.” Frony said. “That boy conjure him.”
“Hush your mouth.” Dilsey said, “Aint you got no bet'
ter sense than that. What you want to listen to Roskus
for, anyway. Get in, Benjy.”
Dilsey pushed me and I got in the bed, where Luster already was. He was alseep. Dilsey took a long piece of wood and laid it between Luster and me. “Stay on your
side now.” Dilsey said. “Luster little, and you don’t want
to hurt him.”
You cant go yet, T. P. said. Wait.
We looked around the corner of the house and
watched the carriages go away.
“Now.” T. P. said. He took Quentin up and we ran down to the comer of the fence and watched them pass. “There he go,” T. P. said. “See that one with the glass in
it. Look at him. He laying in there. See him.”
Come on, Luster said, I going to fake this here bali down home, where I wont lose it. Naw, sir, you cant have it. If them men sees you with it, theyll say you stole
it. Hush up, now. You cant have it. What business you got

“How did you all get back out.” Frony said. “WeVe got company.” Caddy said. ‘‘Father said for us
to mind me tonight. I expect you and T. P. will have to mind me too.” “Im not going to mind you.” Jason said. “Frony and
T. P, dont have to either.” “They will if I say so.” Caddy said. “Maybe I wont say
for them to.” “T. P. dont mind nobody,” Frony said. “Is they started
the funeral yet.”
“What s a funeral.” Jason said. “Didn’t mammy tell you not to tell them.” Versh said. “Where they moans.” Frony said. “They moaned twc
days on Sis Beulah Clay.”
They moaned at Dilseys house, Dilsey was moaning.
When Dilsey moaned Luster said, Hush, and we hushed^
and then 1 began to cry and Blue howled under tl%e kitchen steps. Then Dilsey stopped and we stopped,
“Oh.’' Caddy said. “That’s niggers. White folks dont
have funerals.” Mammy said us not to tell them, Frony.” Versh said. “Tell them what.” Caddy said. Dilsey moaned, and when it got to the place I began
to cry and Blue howled under the steps. Luster, Frony,
said in the window. Take them down to the barn. I cant
get no cooking done with all that racket. That hound too. Get them outen here, I aint going down there. Luster said. I might meet
pappy down there, I seen him last night, waving his arms
in the barn,
“I hke to know why not.” Frony said. “White folks dies

The bones rounded out of the ditch, where the dark
vines were in the black ditch, into the moonlight, like some of the shapes had stopped. Then they all stopped
and it was dark, and when I stopped to start again 1 could hear Mother, and feet walking fast away, and I could smell it. Then the room came, but my eyes went
shut. I didn’t stop. I could smell it. T. P. unpinned the
bed clothes. "Hush.” he said, "Shhhhhhhh.”
But I could smell it, T. P. pulled me up and he put on my clothes fast. "Hush, Benjy.” he said. "We going down to our house.
You want to go down to our house, where Frony is. Hush. Shhhhh.”
He laced my shoes and put my cap on and we went
out. There was a light in the hall. Across the hall we
could hear Mother.
"Shhhhhh, Benjy.” T. P. said, "WeU be out m b minute.”
A door opened and I could smell it more than ever, and a head came out. It wasn’t Father. Father was sick there. "Can you take him out of the house.”
"That’s where we going.” T. P. said. Dilsey came up
the stairs. "Hush.” she said, "Hush. Take him down home, T. P. Frony fixing him a bed. You all look after him, now.
Hush, Benjy. Go on with T. P.” She went where we could hear Mother.

“He smell it’' T. P. said. “Is that the way you found it out.” We went down the steps, where our shadows were.
“I forgot your coat.” T. P. said. “You ought to had it But I aint going back.”
Dan howled.
“Hush now.” T. P. said. Our shadows moved, but Dan s shadow didn’t move except to howl when he did.
“I cant take you down home, bellering like you is.” T. P. said. ‘TTou was bad enough before you got that bull- frog voice. Come on.” We went along the brick walk, with our shadows.
The pig pen smelled like pigs. The cow stood in the lot, chewing at us. Dan howled.
“You going to wake the whole town up.” T. P. said. “Cant you hush.”
We saw Fancy, eating by the branch. The moon shone on the water when we got there. “Naw, sir.” T. P. said, “This too close. We cant stop
here. Come on. Now, just look at you. Got your whole
leg wet. Come on, here.” Dan howled.
The ditch came up out of the buzzing grass. The bones
roxmded out of the black vines. “Now.” T. P. said. “BeHer your head off if you want
to. You got the whole night and a twenty acre pasture to
beller in.” T. P. lay down in the ditch and I sat down, watching
the bones where the buzzards ate Nancy, flapping black

''Do you think buzzards are going to undress Damuddy/"
Caddy said. "Youre crazy.”
"You re a skizzard.” Jason said. He began to cry. "You re a knobnot.” Caddy said. Jason cried. His hands were in his pockets.
"Jason going to be rich naan.” Versh said. "He holding
his money all the time.”
Jason cried. "Now youVe got him started.” Caddy said. "Hush up,
Jason. How can buzzards get in where Damuddy is. Father
wouldn’t let them. Would you let a buzzard undress

Jason hushed. "Frony said it was a funeral.” he said. "Well it’s not.” Caddy said. "It’s a party. Frony dont
know anything about it. He wants your lightning bugs,
T. P. Let him hold it a while.” T. P. gave me the bottle of lightning bugs.
"I bet if we go around to the parlor window we can
see something.” Caddy said. "Then you’U believe me.”
"I already knows.” Frony said. "I dont need to see.” "You better hush your mouth, Frony.” Versh said* "Mammy going whip you,”
"What is it.” Caddy said. "I knows what I knows,” Frony said. "Come on.” Caddy said, "Let’s go around to the front.” We started to go. "T.

“They aint moaning.” Caddy said. “I tell you its a

“We aint going to know what they doing, standing
here.” Versh said. “Come on.” Caddy said. “Frony and T. P. dont have to mind me. But the rest of us do. You better carry him,
Versh. It's getting dark.” Versh took me up and we went on around the kitchen.
When we looked around the corner we could see the
lights coming up the drive, T, P. went back to the cellar door and opened it. You know whafs down there, T. P. said. Soda water,
I seen Mr Jason come up with both hands full of them.
Wait here a minute,
T, P. went and looked in the kitchen door, Dilsey
said. What are you peeping in here for. Where's Benjy.
He out here, T. P, said. Go on and watch him, Dilsey said. Keep him out the
house now,
Yessum, T. P. said. Is they started yet.
You go on and keep that boy out of sight, Dilsey said. I got all I can tend to, A snake crawled out from under the house. Jason said he wasn’t afraid of snakes and Caddy said he was but
she wasn’t and Versh said they botn were and Caddy said
to be quiet, like father said. You aint got to start bellering now, T. P, said. You
want some this sassprilluh.

It tickled my nose and eyes.
If you aint going to drink it, let me get to it, T. P.
said. All right, here tis. We better get another bottle while
nobody bothering us. You be quiet, now. We stopped under the tree by the parlor window.
Versh set me down in the wet grass. It was cold. There were lights in all the windows.
‘ThaTs where Damuddy is.'’ Caddy said. "She's sick every day now. When she gets well we're going to have
a picnic."
"I knows what I knows." Frony said. The ti'ees were buzzing, and the grass. “The one next to it is where we have the measles.* Caddy said. “Where do you and T. P. have the measles^
Frony.”
“Has them just wherever we is, I reckon.” Frony said. “They haven't started yet.” Caddy said. They getting ready to start, T. P. said. You stand
right here now while I get that box so we can see in the
window. Here, les finish drinking this here sassprilluh.
It make me feel just like a squinch owl inside. We drank the sassprilluh and T. P. pushed the bottle through the lattice, under the house, and went away. I could hear them in the parlor and I clawed my hands
against the wall. T. P. dragged the box. He fell down,
and he began to laugh. He lay there, laughing into the
grass. He got up and dragged the box under the window,
trying not to laugh.
“I skeered I going to holler.” T. P. said. “Git on the box
and see is they started." “They haven't started because the band hasn't come
yet." Caddy said. “They aint going to have no band." Frony said. “How do you know.” Caddy said.

“I knows what I knows/’ Frony said. ‘Ton dont know anything/’ Caddy said. She went to
the tree. 'Tush me up, Versh.”
"Your paw told you to stay out that tree.” Versh said. "That was a long time ago.” Caddy said. "I expect he’s forgotten about it. Besides, he said to mind me tonight.
Didn’t he say to mind me tonight.” "I’m not going to mind you.” Jason said. "Frony and
T. P. are not going to either.” "Push me up, Versh.” Caddy said. "All right.” Versh said. "You the one going to get
whipped. I aint.” He went and pushed Caddy up into the tree to the first limb. We watched die muddy bottom
of her drawers. Then we couldn’t see her. We could hear
the tree thrashing.
"Mr Jason said if you break that tree he whip you.”
Versh said. "I’m going to teU on her too.” Jason said. The tree quit thrashing. We looked up into the still branches.
"What you seeing.” Frony whispered.
I saw them. Then I saw Caddy, with flowers in her
hair, and a long veil like shining wind. Caddy Caddy
"Hush.” T. P. said, "They going to hear you. Get down
^uick.” He pulled me. Caddy. I clawed my hands against
the wall Caddy. T. P. pulled me.
"Hush.” he said. "Hush. Come on here quick.” He
pulled me on. Caddy "Hush up, Benjy. You want them
to hear you. Come on, les drink some more sassprilluh,
then we can come back if you hush. We better get one more botde or we both be hollering. We can say Dan
drunk it. Mr Quentin always saying he so smart, we can
say he sassprilluh dog, too.”
THE SOUND AND THE FUKY 59
The moonlight came down the cellar stairs. We drank some more sassprilluh. "'You know what I wish.” T. P. said. "I wish a bear
would walk in that cellar door. You know what I do. 1 walk right up to him and spit in he eye. Gimme that
bottle to stop my mouth before I holler.” T. P. fell down. He began to laugh, and the cellar door
and the moonlight jumped away and something hit me. "Hush up.” T. P. said, trying not to laugh, "Lawd,
theyll all hear us. Get up.” T. P. said, "Get up, Benjy,
quick.” He was thrashing about and laughing and I tried to get up. The cellar steps ran up the hill in the moonlight
and T. P. fell up the hill, into the moonlight, and I ran against the fence and T. P. ran behind me saying
"Hush up hush up” Then he fell into the flowers, laugh'
ing, and I ran into the box. But when I tried to climb
onto it it jumped away and hit me on the back of the
head and my throat made a sound. It made the sound
again and I stopped trying to get up, and it made the
sound again and I began to cry. But my throat kept on making the sound while T. P. was pulling me. It kept on making it and I couldn’t tell if I was crying or not, and
T. P. fell down on top of me, laughing, and it kept on making the sound and Quentin kicked T. P. and Cad
put her arms around me, and her shining veil, and I couldn’t smell trees anymore and I began to cry. Benjy, Caddy said Benjy, She put her arms around me
again, but I went away, "What is it, Benjy.” she said, "Is
it this hat,” She took her hat off and came again, and I went away.
"Benjy.” she said, "What is it, Benjy. What has Caddj
done.”
"He dont Hke that prissy dress.” Jason said. "You thinl

you’re grown up, dont you. You think you’re better than
anybody else, dont you. Prissy.”
“You shut your mouth.” Caddy said, ‘‘You dirty little beast. Benjy.”
“Just because you are fourteen, you think you’re grown
up, dont you.” Jason said. “You drink you’re something.
Dont you.”
“Hush, Benjy.” Caddy said. “You’ll disturb Mother.
Hush.”
But I didn’t hush, and when she went away I followed,
and she stopped on the stairs and waited and I stopped
too.“What is it, Benjy.” Caddy said, “Tell Caddy. She’ll do it. Try.”
“Candace.” Mother said. “Yessum.” Caddy said. “Why are you teasing him.” Mother said. “Bring him
uere.” We went to Mother’s room, where she was lying with
ihe sickness on a cloth on her head.
“What is the matter now.” Mother said. “Benjamin.”
“Benjy.” Caddy said. She came again, but I went away.
“You must have done something to him.” Mother said. “Why wont you let him alone, so I can have some peace.
Give him the box and please go on and let him alone,”
Caddy got the box and set it on the floor and opened
it. It was full of stars. When I was still, they were still. When I moved, they glinted and sparkled. I hushed.
Then I heard Caddy walking and I began again.
“Benjamin.” Mother said, “Come here.” I went to the
door. “You, Benjamin.” Mother said. “What is it now.” Father said, “Where are you going.”
“Take him downstairs and get someone to watch him,
Jason.” Mother said. “You know I’m ill, yet you”
THE SOXJNE AND THE FUKY 61
Father shut the door behind us. 'T. P.” he said.
“Sir.’" T. P. said downstairs.
“Benjy’s coming down.” Father said. “Go with T. P." I went to the bathroom door. I could hear the water.
^"Benjy.” T. P. said downstairs.
I could hear the water. I listened to it. “Eenjy.” T. P. said downstairs.
I hstened to the water.
I couldn’t hear the water, and Caddy opened the door. “Why, Benjy.” she said. She looked at me and I went
and she put her arms around me. “Did you find Caddy
again.” she said. “Did you think Caddy had run away,”
Caddy smelled like trees. We went to Caddy’s room. She sat down at the mirroi. She stopped her hands and looked at me. 'Why, Benjy. What is it.” she said. “You mustn’t cry. Caddy’s not going away. See here.” she said. She took up
the bottle and took the stopper out and held it to my
nose. "Sweet. Smell. Good.”
I went away and I didn’t hush, and she held the bottle in her hand, looking at me.
“Oh.” she said. She put the bottle down and came and
put her arms around me. “So that was it. And you were
trying to teU Caddy and you couldn’t tell her. You
wanted to, but you couldn’t, could you. Of course Caddy
wont. Of course Caddy wont. Just wait till I dress.” Caddy dressed and took up the bottle again and we
went down to the kitchen. “Dilsey.” Caddy said, “Benjy’s got a present for you.’'
She stooped down and put the bottle in my hand. “Hold
it out to Dilsey, now.” Caddy held my hand out and
Dilsey took the bottle. “Well ni declare.” Dilsey said, “If my baby aint give
6% THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
Dilsey a bottle of perfume. Just look here, Roskus.”
Caddy smelled like trees. 'We dont like perfume ourselves.’'
Caddy said. She smelled like trees. "Come on, now.” Dilsey said, "You too big to sleep
with folks. You a big boy now. Thirteen years old. Big
enough to sleep by yourself in Uncle Maury’s room.”
Dilsey said. Uncle Maury was sick. His eye was sick, and his mouth. Versh took his supper up to him on the tray.
"Maury says he’s going to shoot the scoundrel.” Father
said. "I told him he’d better not mention it to Patterson
before hand.” He drank.
"Jason.” Mother said. "Shoot who, Father.” Quentin said. 'What’s Uncle
Maury </interval><interval value=6 novelty=0.7837 residual=-0.0648 level=low>going to shoot him for.” "Because he couldn’t take a little joke.” Father said. "Jason.” Mother said, "How can you. You’d sit right
there and see Maury shot down in ambush, and laugh.”
"Then Maury’d better stay out of ambush.” Father
said. "Shoot who. Father.” Quentin said, "Who’s Uncle
Maury going to shoot.” "Nobody.” Father said. "I dont own a pistol.”
Mother began to cry. "If you begrudge Maury your
food, why aren’t you man enough to say so to his face. To
ridicule him before the children, behind his back.”
"Of course I dont.” Father said, "I admire Maury. He
is invaluable to my own sense of racial superiority. 1 wouldn’t swap Maury for a matched team. And do you
know why, Quentin.”
"No, sir.” Quentin said. "Et ego in arcadia I have forgotten the latin for hay.”
Father said. "There, there.” he said, "I was just joking.”
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 63
He drank and set the glass down and went and put his hand on Mother's shoulder.
“It's no joke." Mother said. “My people are every bit as well born as yours. Just because Maury's health i.« bad."
“Of course." Fatlier said. “Bad health is the primary
reason for all life. Created by disease, within putrefac'
tion, into decay. Versh.”
“Sir." Versh said behind my chair. “Take the decanter and fill it." “And tell Dilsey to come and take Benjamin up t(s bed." Mother said. ‘"You a big boy." Dilsey said, “Caddy tired sleeping
with you. Hush now, so you can go to sleep." The room went away, but I didn't hush, and the room came back
and Dilsey came and sat on the bed, looking at me.
“Aint you going to be a good boy and hush." Dilsey
said. “You aint, is you. See can you wait a minute, then.^ She went away. There wasn't anything in die door
Then Caddy was in it. “Hush.” Caddy said. “I'm coming."
I hushed and Dilsey turned back the spread and
Caddy got in between the spread and the blanket. She
didn't take off her bathrobe.
“Now." she said, “Here I am." Dilsey came with a blanket and spread it over her and tucked it around her. “He be gone in a minute." Dilsey said. “I leave the
light on in your room.”
“All right." Caddy said. She snuggled her head beside
mine on the pillow. “Goodnight, Dilsey."
“Goodnight, honey." Dilsey said. The room went black,
Caddy smelled like trees. We looked up into the tree where she was. ‘What she seeing, Versh." Frony whispered
64 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
'‘SKhhhhhh/' Caddy said in the tree. Dilsey said, '"You come on here.’’ She came around the corner of the house. ‘Whyn t you all go on up stairs, hke your paw
said, stead of slipping out behind my back. Where’s
Caddy and Quentin.”
‘1 told her not to climb up that tree.” Jason said. "Tm
going to tell on her.” "Who in what tree.” Dilsey said. She came and looked
up into the tree. ""Caddy.” Dilsey said. The branches
began to shake again.
""You, Satan.” Dilsey said. ""Come down from there.” ""Hush.” Caddy said, ""Dont you know Father said to be quiet.” Her legs came in sight and Dilsey reached up
and Hfted her out of the tree. ""Aint you got any better sense than to let them come
around here.” Dilsey said.
"*I couldn’t do nothing with her.” Versh said. ""What you all doing here.” Dilsey said. "Who told you
to come up to the house.”
""She did.” Frony said. ""She told us to come.”
""Who told you you got to do what she say.” Dilsey
said. ""Get on home, now.” Frony and T. P. went on. We
couldn’t see them when they were still going away.
""Out here in the middle of the night.” Dilsey said. She took me up and we went to the kitchen.
""Slipping out behind my back.” Dilsey said, ""When
you knowed it’s past your bedtime.”
""Shhhh, Dilsey.” Caddy said. ""Dont talk so loud. We’ve
got to be quiet.” ""You hush yom* mouth and get quiet, then.” Dilsey
said. "Where’s Quentin.”
""Quentin’s mad because he had to mind me tonight.”
Caddy said. ""He’s still got T. P.’s bottle of lightning

"I reckon T. P. can get along without it.” Dilsey said. 'Tou go and find Quentin, Versh. Roskus say he seen him
going towards the barn.” Versh went on. We couldn t see him.
‘'They’re not doing anything in there.” Caddy said, “Just sitting in chairs and looking.”
“They dont need no help from you all to do that.” Dilsey said. We went around the kitchen. Where you want to go now, Luster said. You going
back to watch them knocking ball again. We done looked
for it oner there. Here. Wait a minute. You wait right
here while I go back and get that ball. I done thought of something.
The kitchen was dark. The trees were black on the
sky. Dan came waddling out from under the steps and
chewed my ankle. I went around the kitchen, where the
moon was. Dan came scuffling along, into the moon.
“Benjy.” T. P. said in the house.
The flower tree by the parlor window wasn’t dark, but
the thick trees were. The grass was buzzing in the moonlight
where my shadow walked on the grass. “You, Benjy.” T. P. said in the house. “Where you
hiding. You slipping off. I knows it.” Luster came hack. Wait, he said. Here. Dont go over
there. Miss Quentin and her beau in the swing yonder.
You come on this way. Come back here, Benjy.
It was dark under the trees. Dan wouldn’t come. He
stayed in the moonlight. Then I could see the swing and
I began to cry. Come away from there, Benjy, Luster said. You know
Miss Quentin going to get mad.
It was two now, and then one in the swing. Cadd)/ came fast, white in the darkness.

pulled Caddy’s dress. “Benjy.” Caddy said. “It’s just Charlie. Dont you know
Charlie.” “Where’s his nigger.” Charlie said. “What do they let him run around loose for.” “Hush, Benjy.” Caddy said. “Go away, Charhe. He
doesn’t hke you.” Charhe went away and I hushed. I pulled at Caddy’s dress. “Why, Benjy.” Caddy said. “Aren’t you going to let me stay here and talk to Charhe awhile.”
“Call that nigger.” Charhe said. He came back. I cried louder and pulled at Caddy’s dress. “Go away, Charlie.” Caddy said. Charhe came and
put his hands on Caddy and I cried more. I cried loud.
'TN'o, no.” Caddy said. “No. No.”
“He cant talk.” Charhe said. “Caddy.”
“Are you crazy.” Caddy said. She began to breathe

breathed fast. ^Tlease. Please.” Caddy whispered
“Send him away.” Charhe said. “I will.” Caddy said. “Let me go.”
“Win you send him away.” Charhe said. “Yes.” Caddy said. “Let me go.” Charhe went away.
Hush. Caddy said. “He’s gone.” I hushed. I could hear

“I’ll have to take him to the house.” she said. She took

*Wait.” Charhe said. “Call the nigger.”

'‘‘No/’ Caddy said. ‘Til come back. Come on, Benjy.’^
“Caddy.” Charlie whispered, loud. We went on. “You

the porch, and Caddy knelt down in the dark and held me. I could hear her and feel her chest. “I wont.” she
said. “I wont anymore, ever. Benjy. Benjy ” Then she was
crying, and I cried, and we held each other. “Hush.” she
said. “Hush. I wont anymore,” So I hushed and Caddy
got up and we went into the kitchen and turned the light on and Caddy took the kitchen soap and washed her
mouth at the sink, hard. Caddy smelled like trees. I kept a telling you to stay away from there. Luster
said. They sat up in the swing, quick. Quentin had her
hands on her hair. He had a red tie. You old crazy loon, Quentin said. Tm going to tell Dilsey about the way you let him follow everyivhere
I go. Tm going to make her whip you good.
“I couldn't stop liim.” Luster said. “Come on here,

“Yes you could.” Quentin said. “You didn't try. You
were both snooping around after me. Did Grandmother
send you all out here to spy on me.” She jumped out
of the swing. “If you dont take him right away this minute
and keep him away, I'm going to make Jason whip

“I cant do nothing with him.” Luster said. “You try
it if you think you can.” ‘Shut your mouth.” Quentin said. “Are you going to get him away.”
“Ah, let him stay.” he said. He had a red tie. The sun

put it in his mouth. Then he took the match out of his mouth. It was still burning. "Want to try it.” he said. I went over there. "Open your mouth.” he said. I opened
my mouth. Quentin hit the match with her hand and it went away.
"Goddamn you.” Quentin said. "Do you want to get
him started. Dont you know hell beller all day. Tm going
to tell Dilsey on you.” She went away running.
"Here, kid.” he said. "Hey. Come on back. I aint going

Quentin ran on to the house. She went around the
kitchen. "You played hell then. Jack.” he said. "Aint you.”
"He cant tell what you saying.” Luster said. "He deef

"Is.” he said. "How long s he been that way.”
"Been that way thirty-three years today.” Luster said. "Bom looney. Is you one of them show folks.” '"Why.” he said. "I dont ricklick seeing you around here before.” Luster
said. "Well, what about it.” he said. "Nothing.” Luster said. "I going tonight.”
He looked at me. "You aint the one can play a tune on that saw, is you.” Luster said.
'Ttll cost you a quarter to find that out.” he said. He
looked at me. "Why dont they lock him up.” he said. "What’d you bring him out here for.” "You aint talking to me,” Luster said. "I cant do

“What for.” he said. ""What do I want with it.” “I didn’t think you did.” Luster said. “Come on here,

and gave it to me. It was bright.
Where’d you get that.” he said. His tie was red in the sun, walking.
“Found it under this here bush.” Luster said. ""I thought

He came and took it. “Hush.” Luster said. ""He going to give it back when
he done looking at it.” “Agnes Mabel Becky.” he said. He looked toward the
house.
""Hush.” Luster said. “He fixing to give it back.”
He gave it to me and I hushed.
“Who come to see her last night.” he said. “I dont know.” Luster said. “They comes every night
she can climb down that tree. I dont keep no track of them.”
“Damn if one of them didn’t leave a track.” he said- He looked at the house. Then he went and lay down in the swing. “Go away.” he said. “Dont bother me.”
“Come on here.” Luster said. “You done played hell now. Time Miss Quentin get done telling on you.”
70 THE SOU^TD AND THE EXJEY
We went to the fence and looked through the curling
flower spaces. Luster hunted in the grass.
'1 had it right here.’" he said. I saw the flag flapping,
and the sun slanting on the broad grass.
"'They’ll be some along soon.” Luster said. "There some now, but they going away. Come on and help me
look for it.” We went along the fence.
""Hush.” Luster said. ""How can I make them come
over here, if they aint coming. Wait. They’ll be some in a minute. Look yonder. Here they come.”
I went along the fence, to the gate, where the girls
passed with their booksatchels. "Tou, Benjy Luster
said. ""Come back here.” You cant do no good looking through the gate, T, P.
said. Miss Caddy done gone long ways atoay. Done gat
married and left you. You cant do no good, holding to the gate and crying. She cant hear you. What is it he wants, T, P. Mother said. Cant you play
with him and keep him quiet.
He want to go down yonder and look through the gate,
T, P. said. Well, he cannot do it. Mother said. IPs raining. You
will just have to play loith him and keep him quiet. You,
Benjamin.
Aint nothing going to quiet him, T. P. said. He ihink

Nonsense, Mother said.
I could hear them talking. I went out the door and I couldn’t hear them, and I went down to the gate, where
the girls passed with their booksatchels. They looked at me, walking fast, with their heads turned. I tried to say, but they went on, and I went along the fence, trying to

say, and they went faster. Then they were running and
I came to the comer of the fence and I couldn t go any
further, and I held to the fence, looking after them andl trying to say.
'“You, Benjy.'" T. P. said. "What you doing, slipping
out. Dont you know Dilsey whip you.^' ""You cant do no good, moaning and slobbering through
the fence.” T. P. said. "Tou done skeered them chillen. Look at them, walking on the other side of the street.^ How did he get out. Father said. Did you leave the
gate unlatched when you came in, Jason. Of course not, Jason said. Dont you know I've got
better sense than to do that. Do you think I wanted anything
like this to happen. This family is bad enough, God
knows. I could have told you, all the time. I reckon you'll
send him to Jackson, now. If Mrs Burgess dont shoot
him first. Hush, Father said.
I could have told you, all the time, Jason said.
It was open when I touched it, and I held to it in the
twilight. I wasn’t crying, and I tried to stop, watching
the girls coming along in the twilight. I wasn’t crying. ""There he is.” They stopped.
""He cant get out. He wont hurt anybody, anyway.
Come on.”
""I’m scared* to. I’m scared. I’m going to cross the
street.” ""He cant get out.”
I wasn’t crying.
""Don’t be a Traid cat. Come on.” They came on in the twilight. I wasn’t crying, and I held to the gate. They came slow.
’J^ THE SOUND AND THE FURY
"Im scared.” ''He wont hurt you. I pass here every day. He just runs along the fence.” They came on. I opened the gate and they stopped,
turning. I was trying to say, and I caught her, trying to
say, and she screamed and I was trying to say and trying
and the bright shapes began to stop and I tried to get
out. I tried to get it off of my face, but the bright shapes were going again. They were going up the hill to where
it fell away and I tried to cry. But when I breathed in,
I couldn't breathe out again to cry, and I tried to keep
from falling off the hill and I fell off the hill into the
bright, whirling shapes.
Here, loony, Luster said. Here come some. Hush your
slobbering and moaning, now. They came to the flag. He took it out and they hit, then
he put the flag back.
"Mister.” Luster said. He looked around. "What.” he said. "Want to buy a golf ball.” Luster said. "Let's see it.” he said. He came to the fence and Luster
reached the ball through.
"Where'd you get it.” he said. "Found it.” Luster said. "I know that.” he said. "Where. In somebody's golf
bag.”
"I found it laying over here in the yard.” Luster said.
"I'll take a quarter for it.” "What makes you think it's yours.” he said.
"I found it.” Luster said. "Then find yourself another one.” he said. He put it in his pocket and went away.
"I got to go to that show tonight.” Luster said.

'That SO.” he said. He went to the table. ‘Tore, cad-^ die.” he said. He hit. “Ill declare.” Luster said. “You fusses when you dont
see them and you fusses when you does. Why cant you
hush. Dont you reckon folks gets tired of listening to you all the time. Here. You dropped your jimson weed.”
He picked it up and gave it back to me. “You needs a new one. You Tout wore that one out.” We stood at the
fence and watched them.
“That white man hard to get along with.” Luster said. “You see him take my ball.” They went on. We went on
along the fence. We came to the garden and we couldht
go any further. I held to the fence and looked through the
flower spaces. They went away.
“Now you aint got nothing to moan about.” Luster
said. “Hush up. I the one got something to moan over, you aint. Here. Whyn t you hold on to that weed. You be
bellering about it next.” He gave me the flower. “Where
you heading now.”
Our shadows were on the grass. They got to the trees before we did. Mine got there first. Then we got there,
and then the shadows were gone. There was a flower in the bottle. I put the other flower in it. “Aint you a grown man, now.” Luster said. “Playing
with two weeds in a bottle. You know what they going
to do with you when Miss Cahline die. They going to send you to Jackson, where you belong. Mr Jason say so. Where you can hold the bars all day long with the rest of the looneys and slobber. How you like that.” Luster knocked the flowers over with his hand. ‘That’s what theyll do to you at Jackson when you starts beller- mg.
I tried to pick up the flowers. Luster picked them up,
and they went away. I began to cry.

"Beller.” Luster said. ''Beller, You want something to

"Caddy. Beller now, Caddy.”
"Luster.” Dilsey said from the kitchen.
The flowers came back.
"Hush.” Luster said. "Here they is. Look. It’s fixed back just like it was at first. Hush, now.”
‘Y'ou, Luster.” Dilsey said. "Yessum.” Luster said. "We coming. You done played

out of the trees. Our shadows were gone.
"Hush.” Luster said. "Look at all them folks watching
you. Hush.”
‘Tou bring him on here.” Dilsey said. She came down
the steps.
‘‘What you done to him now.” she said. "Aint done nothing to him.” Luster said. "He just started bellering.”
‘Tes you is.” Dilsey said. “You done something to him.
Where you been.”
"Over yonder under them cedars.” Luster said. "Getting Quentin all riled up.” Dilsey said. ‘Why cant

"I aint done nothing to him.” Luster said. "He was
playing there, and all of a sudden he started bellering.”
"Is you been projecking with his graveyard.” Dilsey
said. "I aint touched his .graveyard.” Luster said. Dont lie to me, boy.” Dilsey said. We went up the? steps and into the kitchen. Dilsey opened the firedoor

“I aint been teasing him.” Luster said. “He was playing

"Tou aint done nothing to his flowers.” Dilsey said. “I aint touched his graveyard.” Luster said. “What 1 want with his truck. I was just hunting for that quarter.”
“You lost it, did you.” Dilsey said. She lit the candles on the cake. Some of them were little ones. Some were
big ones cut into little pieces. “I told you to go put it away. Now I reckon you want me to get you anothei one from Frony.”
“I got to go to that show, Benjy or no Benjy.” Luster
said. “I aint going to follow him aroimd day and nighi both.” “You going to do just what he want you to, nigger

“Aint I always done it.” Luster said. “Dont I always

“Then you keep it up.” Dilsey said. “Bringing him

ahead and eat this cake, now, before Jason come. I dont want him jumping on me about a cake J bought
76 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
with my own money. Me baking a cake here, with him
counting every egg that comes into this kitchen. See can you let him alone now, less you dont want to go to that show tonight.”
Dilsey went away.
''You cant blow out no candles.” Luster said. "Watch
me blow them out.” He leaned down and puJffed his face. The candles went away. I began to cry. "Hush.” Luster
said. "Here. Look at the fire whiles I cuts this cake.”
I could hear the clock, and I could hear Caddy standing
behind me, and I could hear the roof. Ifs still raining,
Caddy said. I hate rain. I hate everything. And then
her head came into my lap and she was crying, holding
me, and I began to cry. Then I looked at the fire again
and the bright, smooth shapes went again. I could hear
the clock and the roof and Caddy.
I ate some cake. Luster s hand came and took another
piece. I could hear him eating. I looked at the fire. A long piece of wire came across my shoulder. It went
to the door, and then the fire went away. I began to cry. "What you howling for now.” Luster said. "Look
there.” The fire was there. I hushed. "Cant you set and
look at the fire and be quiet like mammy told you.” Luster said. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Here.
Here’s you some more cake.” "What you done to him now.” Dilsey said. "Cant you
never let him alone.”
"I was just trying to get him to hush up and not sturb
Miss Cahline.” Luster said. "Something got him started
again.”
"And I know what that something name.” Dilsey said. "Tm going to get Versh to take a stick to you when he
comes home. You just trying yourself. You been doing
it all day. Did you take him down to the branch.”
THE SOUKD and the FXJEY 77
“Nome.” Luster said. ''We been right here in this yard
all day, like you said.” His hand came for another piece of cake. Dilsey hit his hand. “Reach it again, and I chop it right o£E with
this here butcher knife.” Dilsey said. “I bet he aint had
one piece of it.” “Yes he is.” Luster said. “He already had twice as much as me. Ask him if he aint.” “Reach hit one more time.” Dilsey said. '‘Just reach it."^ That's right, Dilsey said. 1 reckon it'll he my time to cry next. Reckon Maury going to let me cry on him a
while, too. His name's Benjy now, Caddy said. How come it is, Dilsey said. He aint wore out the name
he vms horn with yet, is he. Benjamin came out of the hihle, Caddy said. It's a
better name for him than Maury was. How come it is, Dilsey said. Mother says it is, Caddy said. Huh, Dilsey said. Name aint going to help him. Hurt
him, neither. Folks dont have no luck, changing names. My name heen Dilsey since fore I could rememher and it be Dilsey when they's long forgot me. How will they know it's Dilsey, when it's long forgot^
Dilsey, Caddy said.
It'll be in the Book, honey, Dilsey said. Writ out. Can you read it, Caddy said. Wont have to, Dilsey said. They'll read it for me. All
I got to do is say Ise here. The long wire came across my shoulder, and the fire went away. I began to cry. Dilsey and Luster fought.
“I seen you.” Dilsey said. “Oho, I seen you.” She
dragged Luster out of the corner, shaking him, “Wasnf

aothing bothering him, was they. You just wait till your
pappy come home. I wish I was young like I use to be,
I'd tear them years right off your head. I good mind to lock you up in that cellar and not let you go to that show
tonight, I sho is.” ''Ow, mammy.” Luster said. "Ow, mammy.”
I put my hand out to where the fire had been.
''Catch him.” Dilsey said. "Catch him back.”
My hand jerked back and I put it in my mouth and
Dilsey caught me. I could still hear the clock between
my voice. Dilsey reached back and hit Luster on the
head. My voice was going loud every time.
"Get that soda.” Dilsey said. She took my hand out of my mouth. My voice went louder then and my hand tried
to go back to my mouth, but Dilsey held it. My voice
went loud. She sprinkled soda on my hand.
"Look in the pantry and tear a piece off of that rag
hanging on the nail.” she said. "Hush, now. You dont
want to make your ma sick again, does you. Here, look
at the fire. Dilsey make your hand stop hurting in just a minute. Look at the fire.” She opened the fire door. I looked at the fire, but my hand didn't stop and I didn't
stop. My hand was trying to go to my mouth but Dilsey
held it. She wrapped the cloth around it. Mother said,
"What is it now. Cant I even be sick in peace. Do I have to get up out of bed to come down to him, with two
grown negroes to take care of him.”
"He all right now.” Dilsey said. "He going to quit.
He just burnt his hand a little.” "With two grown negroes, you must bring him into the house, bawling.” Mother said. 'You got him started on purpose, because you know Vm sick.” She came and
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 73
Stood by me. ''Hush.’" she said. ‘‘Right this minute. Did
you give him this cake.”
“I bought it.” Dilsey said. “It never come out of Ja- son s pantry. I fixed him some birthday.”
“Do you want to poison him with that cheap store cake.” Mother said. “Is that what you are trying to do» Am I never to have one minute's peace.”
"^You go on back up stairs and lay down.” Dilsey said*
“It'll quit smarting him in a minute now, and hell hush.
Come on, now.”
“And leave him down here for you all to do something
else to.” Mother said. “How can I lie there, with him
bawling down here. Benjamin. Hush this minute.”
“They aint nowhere else to take him.” Dilsey said. “We
aint got the room we use to have. He cant stay out in the yard, crying where all the neighbors can see him.”
“I know, I know.” Mother said. “It's all my fault. I'll be gone soon, and you and Jason will both get along
better.” She began to cry. “You hush that, now.” Dilsey said. “You'll get yourself
down again. You come on back up stairs. Luster going to take him to the liberry and play with him till I get his supper done.”
Dilsey and Mother went out. “Hush up.” Luster said. “You hush up. You want
me to burn your other hand for you. You aint hurt. Hush
“Here.” Dilsey said. “Stop crying, now.” She gave me
the slipper, and I hushed. “Take him to the liberry.”
she said. “And if I hear him again, I going to whip you
myself.”
We went to the libraiy. Luster turned on the light
The windows went black, and the dark tall place on
8o THE SOUND AND THE FUUY
the wall came and I went and touched it. It was like a
door, only it wasn’t a door. The fire came behind me and I went to the fire and
sat on the floor, holding the slipper. The fire went higher.
It went onto the cushion in Mother’s chair. ‘‘Hush up.” Luster said. “Cant you never get done for a while. Here I done built you a fire, and you wont even
look at it.” Your name is Benjy. Caddy said. Do you hear. Benjy.
Benjy.
Dont tell him that. Mother said. Bring him here. Caddy lifted me under the arms. Get up, Mau 1 mean Benjy, she said. Dont try to carry him. Mother said. Cant you lead
him over here. Is that too much for you to think of. I can carry him, Caddy said. “Let me carry him up,
Dilsey.”
“Go on. Minute.” Dilsey said. “You aint big enough
to tote a flea. You go on and be quiet, like Mr Jason
said,”
There was a light at the top of the stairs. Father was
there, in his shirt sleeves. The v/ay he looked said Hush.
Caddy whispered,
“Is Mother sick.” Versh set me down and we went into Mothers room. There was a fire. It was rising and falling on the walls. There was another fire in the mirror. I could smell the
sickness. It was a cloth folded on Mothers head. Her
hair was on the pillow. The fire didnt reach it, but it shone on her hand, where her rings were jumping.
“Come and tell Mother goodnight.” Caddy said. We
went to the bed. The fire went out of the mirror. Father
got up from the bed and lifted me up and Mother put
h9X hand on my head.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 8l
‘What time is it. Mother said. Her eyes were closed. “Ten minutes to seven.” Father said. Its too early for him to go to bed.” Mother said. '‘He’U wake up at daybreak, and I simply cannot bear
another day like today.”
“There, there.” Father said. He touched Mother’s face,
“I know I m nothing but a burden to you.” Mother
said. “But Til be gone soon. Then you will be rid of my
bothering.”
Hush. Father said. “TU take him downstairs awhile.’ He took me up. “Come on, old fellow. Let’s go downstairs
awhile. We’ll have to be quiet while Quentin in studying, now.”
Caddy went and leaned her face over the bed and
Mother’s hand came into the firelight. Her rings jumped
on Caddy’s back.
Mothers sick, Father said. Dilsey will put you to had.
Where s Quentin.
Versh getting him, Dilsey said. Father stood and watched us go past. We could hear
Mother in her room. Caddy said “Hush.” Jason was stiU climbing the stairs. He had his hands in his pockets.
“You all must be good tonight.” Father said. “And be
quiet, so you wont disturb Mother.”
“We’ll be quiet.” Caddy said. “You must be quiet now,
Jason.” she said. We tiptoed.
We could hear the roof. I could see the fire in the
mirror too. Caddy lifted me again.
“Come on, now.” she said. “Then you can come back
to the fii'e. Hush, now.”
“Candace.” Mother said. “Hush, Benjy.” Caddy said. “Mother wants you a minute. Like a good boy. Then you can come back
Benjy.”
82 THE SOUND AND THE FUBY
Caddy let me down, and I hushed.
"Let him stay here, Mother. When he"s through look- ing at the fire, then you can tell him.”
"Candace.” Mother said. Caddy stooped and lifted me. We staggered. "Candace.” Mother said. "Hush.” Caddy said. "You can still see it. Hush.'
"Bring him here.” Mother said. “He's too big for you
to carry. You must stop trying. You'll injure your back.
All of our women have prided themselves on their carriage.
</interval><interval value=9 novelty=0.7482 residual=-0.0976 level=low>Do you want to look like a washer-woman.”
"He's not too heavy.” Caddy said. "I can carry him.”
'‘Well, I dont want him carried, then.” Mother said. "A five year old child. No, no. Not in my lap. Let him
stand up.”
"If you'll hold him, he'll stop.” Caddy said. "Hush.”
she said. "You can go right back. Here. Here's your
cushion. See.” "Dont, Candace.” Mother said. "Let him look at it and he'll be quiet.” Caddy said. "Hold up just a minute while I slip it out. There, Benjy.
Look.”
I looked at it and hushed.
"You humour him too much.” Mother said. "You and
your father both. You dont realise that I am the one who
has to pay for it. Damuddy spoiled Jason that way and
it took him two years to outgrow it, and I am not strong
enough to go through the same thing with Benjamin.”
"You dont need to bother with him.” Caddy said. "I
like to take care of him. Dont I, Benjy.”
"Candace.” Mother said. "I told you not to call him
that. It was bad enough when your father insisted on
calling you by that silly nickname, and I will not have
him called by one, Nicfaiames are vulgar. Only common
people use them. Benjamin.” she said.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 83
"Look at me/' Mother said. "Benjamin." she said. She took my face in her hands
and turned it to hers. "Benjamin." she said. ‘Take that cushion away, Candace."
"Hell ciy." Caddy said. "Take that cushion away, like I told you." Mother said
"He must learn to mind."
The cushion went away.
"Hush, Benjy." Caddy said. "You go over there and sit down." Mother said. "Benjamin.”
She held my face to hers. "Stop that.” she said. ''Stop it." But I didn't stop and Mother caught me in her arms and began to cry, and I cried. Then the cushion came
back and Caddy held it above Mothers head. She drew
Mother back in the chair and Mother lay crying against
the red and yellow cushion.
"Hush, Mother.” Caddy said. "You go upstairs and
lay down, so you can be sick. Ill go get Dilsey.” She led me to the fire and I looked at the bright, smooth shapes.
I could hear the fire and the roof. Father took me up. He smelled like rain. "Well, Benjy.” he said. "Have you been a good boy
today.”
Caddy and Jason were fighting in the mirror. "You, Caddy.” Father said. They fought. Jason began to cry. “Caddy.” Father said. Jason was crying. He wasn't
fighting any more, but we could see Caddy fighting in the mirror and Father put me down and went into the mirror and fought too. He Hfted Caddy up. She fought.
Jason lay on the floor, crying. He had the scissors in his hand. Father held Caddy.
84 THE SOUND AND-- THE ' EURY
‘‘He cut up all Benjys dolls/" Caddy said. “I’ll slit his
gizzle.”
“Candace.” Father said. “I will.” Caddy said. “I will.” She fought. Father held
her. She kicked at Jason. He rolled into the comer, out
of the mirror. Father brought Caddy to the fire. They
were all out of the mirror. Only the fire was in it. Like
the fire was in a door. “Stop that.” Father said. “Do you want to make
Mother sick in her room.”
Caddy stopped. “He cut up all the doUs Mau—Benjy
and I made.” Caddy said. “He did it just for meanness.”
“I didn’t.” Jason said. He was sitting up, crying. “I didn’t know they were his. I just thought they were some
old papers.”
“You couldn’t help but know.” Caddy said. “You did
it just.”
“Hush.” Father said. “Jason.” he said.
“I’ll make you some more tomorrow.” Caddy said.
^‘We’ll make a lot of them. Here, you can look at the cushion, too.” Jason came in. I kept telling you to hush. Luster said. What’s the matter now, Jason said. “He just trying hisseH.” Luster said. “That the way he
been going on all day.”
“Why dont you let him alone, then.” Jason said. “If you cant keep him quiet, you’ll have to take him out to the kitchen. The rest of us cant shut ourselves up in a room like Mother does.” “Mammy say keep him out the kitchen till she get
supper.” Luster said. “Then play with him and keep him quiet.” Jason said.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 85
I have to work all day and then come home to a mad house.” He opened the paper and read it. You can look at the fire and the mirror and the cushion
too, Caddy said. You wont have to wait until supper to look at the cushion, now. We could hear the roof. We
could hear Jason too, crying loud beyond the wall. Dilsey said, “You come, Jason. You letting him alone,
is you.”
“Yessum.” Luster said. “Where Quentin.” Dilsey said. “Supper near bout
ready.”
“I dont knowm.” Luster said. “I aint seen her.” Dilsey went away. “Quentin.” she said in the hall. “Quentin. Supper ready.”
We could hear the roof. Quentin smelled like rain, too.What did Jason do, he said. He cut up all Benjys dolls, Caddy said. Mother said to not call him Benjy, Quentin said. He
sat on the rug by us. 1 wish it wouldnt rain, he said. You cant do anything.
Youve been in a fight, Caddy said. Havent you.
It wasnt much, Quentin said. You can tell it, Caddy said. Father'll see it. I dont care, Quentin said. I wish it wouldnt rain. Quentin said, “Didn't Dilsey say supper was ready.”
“Yessum.” Luster said. Jason looked at Quentin. Then
he read the paper again. Quentin came in, “She say it bout ready.” Luster said. Quentin jumped down in Mother s chair. Luster said,
“Mr Jason.” “What.” Jason said. “Let me have two bits.” Luster said. “What for.” Jason said.
86 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
go to the show tonight.” Luster said.
"I thought Dilsey was going to get a quarter from
Frony for you.” Jason said. "She did.” Luster said. "I lost it. Me and Benjy hunted
all day for that quarter. You can ask him.”
"Then borrow one from him.” Jason said. "I have to Work for mine.” He read tlie paper. Quentin looked at the fire. The fire was in her eyes and on her mouth. Her
mouth was red.
"I tried to keep him away from there.” Luster said. "Shut your mouth.” Quentin said. Jason looked at her. ‘What did I tell you I was going to do if I saw you
With that show fellow again.” he said. Quentin looked at the fire. "Did you hear me.” Jason said.
"I heard you.” Quentin said. "Why dont you do it, then.” "Dont you worry.” Jason said. In? not.” Quentin said. Jason read the paper again. I could hear the roof. Father leaned fortoard and
looked at Quentin,
HellOy he said. Who won.
‘Nobody.” Quentin said. “They stopped us. Teachers.”
"Who was it.” Father said. "Will you tell.” "It was all right.” Quentin said. "He was as big as me.”
Trhats good. Father said. "Can you tell what it was
about.”
"It wasn t anything.” Quentin said. "He said he would
put a frog in her desk and she wouldn't dare to whip
him.”
"Oh.” Father said. "She. And then what.”
Wes, sir.” Quentin said. "And then I kind of hit him.”
We could hear the roof and the fire, and a snuffling
Dutside the door.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY \l7 “Where was he going to get a frog in November”
Father said.
“I dont know, sir.” Quentin said. We could hear them.
“Jason/' Father said. We could hear Jason. “Jason.” Father said. "'Come in here and stop that.” We could hear the roof and the fire and Jason. “Stop that, now.” Father said. "Do you want me to whip you again.” Father lifted Jason up into the chai/
by him. Jason snuJBBied. We could hear the fire and the
roof. Jason snuflBied a little louder. “One more time.” Father said. We could hear the fire and the roof. Dilsey said. All right. You all can come on to supper*
Versh smelled like rain. He smelled like a dog, too^ We could hear the -fire and the roof. We could hear Caddy walking fast. Father and Mother
(ooked at the door. Caddy passed it, walking fast. Sh^
didn’t look. She walked fast. “Candace.” Mother said. Caddy stopped walking.
“Yes, Mother.” she said. “Hush, Caroline.” Father said. “Come here.” Mother said. “Hush, Caroline.” Father said. “Let her alone.” Caddy came to the door and stood there, looking ar Father and Mother. Her eyes flew at me, and away. 1 began to cry. It went loud and I got up. Caddy came in and stood with her back to the wall, looking at me. I went toward her, crying, and she shrank against the wall
and I saw her eyes and I cried louder and pulled at her
dress. She put her hands out but I pulled at her dress. Her eyes ran. Versh said. Your name Benjamin now. Yau know how
88 THE SOUND AND THE EURY

when they was about a dozen them bluegum chillen running round the place, he never come home. Possum
hunters found him in the woods, et clean. And you
know who et him. Them bluegum chillen did. We were in the hall. Caddy was still looking at me. Her hand was against her mouth and I saw her eyes
and I cried. We went up the stairs. She stopped again,
against the wall, looking at me and I cried and she
went on and I came on, crying, and she shrank against
the wall, looking at me. She opened the door to her
room, but I pulled at her dress and we went to the bath- room and she stood against the door, looking at me. Then she put her arm across her face and I pushed at
her, crying.
What are you doing to him, Jason said. Why cant you
let him alone.
I aint touching him, Luster said. He been doing this way all day long. He needs whipping.
He needs to be sent to Jackson, Quentin said. How
can anybody live in a house like this. If you dont like it, young lady, youd better get out, Jason said. Tm going to, Quentin said. Dont you worry.
Versh said, ‘Tou move back some, so I can dry my
legs oflE.” He shoved me back a little. ‘‘Dont you start bellering, now. You can still see it. That’s all you have to
do. You aint had to be out in the rain Hke 1 is. You’s bom

fire.‘‘Yon know how come your name Benjamin now,”
Versh said. '‘Your mamma too proud for you. What

“You be still there and let me dry my legs off.” Versh
said. "Or you know what 111 do. Ill </interval><interval value=10 novelty=0.7562 residual=-0.0887 level=low>skin your rmktum.’'
We could hear the fire and the roof and Versh.
Versh got up quick and jerked his legs back. Fathd
said, "All right, Versh.”
Til feed him tonight.” Caddy said. "Sometimes b'f cries when Versh feeds him.”
"Take this tray up,” Dilsey said. "And hurry back and
feed Benjy.”
"Dont you want Caddy to feed you.” Caddy said. Has he got to keep that old dirty slipper on the table^ Quentin said. Why dont you feed him in the kitchen. Ifs like eating with a pig.
If you dont like the way we eat, youd better not come
to the table, Jason said. Steam came off of Roskus. He was sitting in front of the stove. The oven door was open and Roskus had his feet in it. Steam came off the bowl. Caddy put the spoon
into my mouth easy. There was a black spot on the inside of the bowl.
Now, now, Dilsey said. He aint going to bother you no more.
It got down below the mark. Then the bowl was
empty. It went away. "He’s hungry tonight.” Caddy said. The bowl came back. I couldn’t see the spot. Then I could. "He’s starved, tonight.” Caddy said. "Look how
much he’s eaten.” Yes he will, Quentin said. You all send him out to spy on me. I hate this house. Tm going to run away.
JO the sound and the euky
Roskus said, “It going to rain all night/’
Youve been running a long time, not to got any
further o-ff than mealtime, Jason said. See if I dont, Quentin said. “Then I dont know what I going to do/’ Dilsey said*
“It caught me in the hip so bad now I cant scarcely move.
Climbing them stairs all evening.”
Oh, I loouldnt be surprised, Jason said. I wouldnt
f)e surprised at anything youd do. Quentin threw her napkin on the table. Hush your mouth, Jason, Dilsey said. She went and
put her arm around Quentin. Sit down, honey, Dilsey
said. He ought to be shamed of hisself, throwing what
aint your fault up to you. “She sulling again, is she.” Roskus said. “Hush your mouth.” Dilsey said. Quentin pushed Dilsey away. She looked at Jason. Her
mouth was red. She picked up her glass of water and
swung her arm back, looking at Jason. Dilsey caught her
arm. They fought. The glass broke on the table, and the
water ran into the table. Quentin was running.
“Mother’s sick again.” Caddy said. “Sho she is.” Dilsey said. ‘Weather like this make
anybody sick. When you going to get done eating, boy.”
Goddamn you, Quentin said. Goddamn you. We could
hear her running on the stairs. We went to the library.
Caddy gave me the cushion, and I could look at the
cushion and the mirror and the fire. ‘We must be quiet while Quentin’s studying.” Father
said. ‘What are you doing, Jason.” “Nothing.” Jason said. “Suppose you come over here to do it, then.” Father
mid.
Jason came out of the corner.
THE SOXJJSTD AND THE THEY 91
‘What are you chewing/’ Father said. "Nothing.” Jason said. "He's chewing paper again.” Caddy said. "Come here, Jason,” Father said. Jason threw into the fire. It hissed, uncurled, turuing
black. Then it was gray. Then it was gone. Caddy and
Father and Jason were in Mother’s chair. Jason’s eyes were puffed shut and his mouth moved, like tasting.
Caddy’s head was on Father’s shoulder. Her hair was
like fire, and little points of fire were in her eyes, and I went and Father lifted me into the chair too, and Caddy
held me. She smelled like trees She smelled like trees. In the corner it was dark, hui
I could see the window, I squatted there, holding the
slipper, I couldnt see it, hut my hands saw it, and I could
hear it getting night, and my hands saw the slipper but
I couldnt see myself, but my hands could see the slipper
and I squatted there, hearing it getting dark. Here you is. Luster said. Look what I got. He showed
it to me. You know where 1 got it. Miss Quentin gave it to me, I knowed they couldnt keep me out. What
you doing, off in here, I thought you done slipped back
out doors, Aint you done enough moaning and slobbering
today, without hiding off in this here empty room,
mumbling and taking on. Come on here to bed, so I can
get up there before it starts. I cant fool with you all night tonight. Just let them horns toot the first toot and I done gone.
We didn’t go to our room.
"This is where we have the measles.” Caddy said. "Why do we have to sleep in here tonight.”
"What you care where you sleep.” Dilsey said. She
shut the door and sat down and began to undress me
Jason began to cry. "Hush.” Dilsey said.
92 THE SOUND AND THE EUKY
"I want to sleep with Damuddy.” Jason said.
‘"She's sick." Caddy said. “You can sleep with her when
she gets well. Cant he, Dilsey."
“Hush, now.” Dilsey said. Jason hushed.
“Our nighties are here, and everything.” Caddy said. ^Ifs like moving.”
“And you better get into them.” Dilsey said. “You be
unbuttoning Jason.” Caddy unbuttoned Jason. He began to cry. “You want to get whipped.” Dilsey said. Jason hushed.
Quentin, Mother said in the halL
What, Quentin said beyond the wall. We heard Mother
lock the door. She looked in our door and came in and
Ttooped over the bed and kissed me on the forehead.
When you get him to bed, go and ask Dilsey if she
objects to my having a hot water bottle, Mother said. Tell her that if she does, Til try to get along without it. Tell her I just want to know.
Yessum, Luster said. Come on. Get your pants off. Quentin and Versh came in. Quentin had his face
turned av/ay. “What are you crying for.” Caddy said. “Hush.” Dilsey said. “You all get undressed, now. You
can go on home, Versh.”
I got undressed and I looked at myself, and I began
to cry. Hush, Luster said. Looking for them aint going
to do no good. They re gone. You keep on like this, and we aint going have you no more birthday. He put my
gown on. I hushed, and then Luster stopped, his head
toward the window. Then he went to the window and
looked out. He came back and took my arm. Here she
come, he said. Be quiet, now. We went to the window
and looked out. It came out of Quentins window and
climbed across into the tree. We watched the tree

shaking. The shaking went down the tree^ then it came
out and we watched it go away across the grass. Then
we coiddnt see it. Come on. Luster said. There now. Hear them horns. You get in that bed while my foots behaves.
There were two beds. Quentin got in the other one. He turned his face to the wall. Dilsey put Jason in with
him. Caddy took her dress off. ‘‘Just look at your drawers.'" Dilsey said. “You better be glad your ma aint seen you."
“I already told on her.” Jason said.
“I bound you would.” Dilsey said. “And see what you got by it.” Caddy said. “Tattletale.” “What did I get by it.” Jason said. “Whyn't you get your nightie on.” Dilsey said. She
went and helped Caddy take off her bodice and drawers.
“Just look at you.” Dilsey said. She wadded the drawers
and scrubbed Caddy behind with them. “It done soaked
clean through onto you.” she said. “But you wont get no
bath this night. Here,” She put Caddy's nightie on her
and Caddy chmbed into the bed and Dilsey went to the
door and stood with her hand on the hght. “You all be
quiet now, you hear.” she said. “All right.” Caddy said. “Mother’s not coming in to- night.” she said. “So we still have to mind me.”
“Yes.” Dilsey said. “Go to sleep, now.”
“Mother’s sick.” Caddy said. “She and Damuddy are both sick.” “Hush.” Dilsey said. 'Tou go to sleep.”
The room went black, except the door. Then the door
went black. Caddy said, “Hush, Maury,” putting her
hand on me. So I stayed hushed. We could hear us. We
could hear the dark.
94 THE SOUND AND THE FUBY
It went away, and Father looked at ns. He looked at Quentin and Jason, then he came and kissed Caddy and
put his hand on my head.
'Is Mother very sick.” Caddy said. "No."' Father said. ^'Are you going to take good care of
Maury.”
"Yes.” Caddy said. Father went to the door and looked at us again. Then
the dark came back, and he stood black m the door, and
then the door turned black again. Caddy held me and I could hear us all, and the darkness, and something I could smell. And then I could see the windows, where
the trees were buzzing. Then the dark began to go in smooth, bright shapes, like it always does, even when
Caddy says that I have been asleep.

WHEN THE SHADOW OF THE SASH APPEABED ON THE
curtains it was between seven and eight oclock
and then I was in time again, hearing the watch. It was
Grandfathers and when Father gave it to me he said,
Quentin, I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire;
it’s rather excrutiating-ly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience
which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his father s. I give it to you not that you may
remember time, but that you might forget it now and
then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying
to conquer it. Because no battle is ever won he said. They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man
his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.
It was propped against the collar box and I lay listen- ing to it. Hearing it, that is. I dont suppose anybody ever
deliberately listens to a watch or a clock. You dont have
to. You can be oblivious to the sound for a long while,
then in a second of ticking it can create in the mind un- broken the long diminishing parade of time you didn’t 95

hear. Like Father said down the long and lonely lightrays
you might see Jesus walking, like. And the good
Saint Francis that said Little Sister Death, that never had a sister. Through the wall I heard Shreve’s bed-springs and
then his slippers on the floor hishing. I got up and went
to the di'esser and slid my hand along it and touched
the watch and turned it face-down and went back to bed. But the shadow of the sash was still there and I had learned to tell almost to the minute, so Fd have to turn my back to it, feeling the eyes animals used to have
in the back of their heads when it was on top, itching. Ifs always the idle habits you acquire which you will
regret. Father said that. That Christ was</interval><interval value=11 novelty=0.8756 residual=0.0316 level=normal> not crucified: he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels.
That had no sister. And so as soon as I knew I couldn't see it, I began to wonder what time it was. Father said that constant
speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbiti'ary dial which is a symptom of mind-function.
Excrement Father said like sweating. And I saying
All right. Wonder. Go on and wonder.
If it had been cloudy I could have looked at the window,
thinking what he said about idle habits. Thinking
it would be nice for them down at New London if the
weather held up like this. Why shouldn't it? The month
of brides, the voice that breathed She ran right out of the mirror^ out of the banked sceirt. Roses, Roses. Mr
and Mrs Jason Richmond Compson announce the marriage

Jason have it Give Jason a year at Harvard.
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 97
Shreve stood in the door, putting his collar on, his
glasses glinting rosily, as though he had washed them
with his face. ''You taking a cut this morning?'’
"Is it that late?” He looked at his watch, "Bell in two minutes.”
"I didn’t know it was that late.” He was still looking
at the watch, his mouth shaping. "I’ll have to hustle. I cant stand another cut. The dean told me last week
—
He put the watch back into his pocket. Then I quit
talking.
"You’d better slip on your pants and run,” he said. He went out.
I got up and moved about, listening to him through
the wall. He entered the sitting-room, toward the door.
"Aren’t you ready yet?”
"Not yet. Run along. I’ll make it.” He went out. The door closed. His feet went down the
corridor. Then I could hear the watch again. I quit
moving around and went to the window and drew the
curtains aside and watched them running for chapel,
the same ones fighting the same heaving coat-sleeves, the same books and flapping collars flushing past like debris on a flood, and Spoade. Calhng Shreve my husband. Ah
let him alone, Shreve said, if he’s got better sense than
to chase after the little dirty sluts, whose business. In
the South you are ashamed of being a virgin. Boys. Men.
They lie about it. Because it means less to women.
Father said. He said it was men invented virginity not women. Father said it’s like death: only a state in which
the others are left and I said, But to believe it doesn’t matter and he said. That’s what’s so sad about anything: not only virginity, and I said, Why couldn’t it have been
me and not her who is unvirgin and he said, That’s why
that’s sad too; nothing is even worth the changing of it;
the sound and the exjry
and Shreve said if he’s got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and I said Did you ever have a sis- ter? Did you? Did you?
Spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a
street full of scuttering dead leaves, his collar about his
ears, moving at his customary unhurried walk. He was
from South Carolina, a senior. It was his club’s boast that
he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time
and had never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet About ten oclock he’d come
in Thompson’s, get two cups of coffee, sit down and take
his socks out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put
them on while the coffee cooled. About noon you’d see him with a shirt and collar on, Kke anybody else. The
others passed him running, but he never increased his pace at all. After a while the quad was empty.
A sparrow slanted across the sunlight, onto the window
ledge, and cocked his head at me. His eye was round
and bright. First he’d watch me with one eye, then flick! and it would be the other one, his throat pumping faster than any pulse. The hour began to strike. The sparrow
quit swapping eyes and watched me steadily vnth the same one until the chimes ceased, as if he were Hstening
too. Then he flicked off the ledge and was gone.
It was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating.
It stayed in the air, more felt than heard, for a long time.
Like all the bells that ever fang still ringing in the long
dying light-rays and Jesus and Saint Francis talking
about his sister. Because if it were just to hell; if that were ail of it. Finished. If things just finished themselves.
Nobody else there but her and me. If we could just have
done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us. I have committed incest I said Father it

be tliere and she would and I would. Dalton Ames. Dal- ton Ames. Dalton Ames. If we could have just done something
so dreadful and Father said That’s sad too, people
cannot do anything that dreadful they cannot do anything
very dreadful at all they cannot even remember to- morrow what seemed dreadful today and I said, You can
shirk all things and he said, Ah can you. And I will look
down and see my murmuring bones and the deep water
like wind, hke a roof of wind, and after a long time they
cannot distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate
sand. Until on the Day when He says Rise only the
flatiron would come floating up. It’s not when you realise that nothing can help you—religion, pride, anything

his mother lying with open body lifted laughing, holding
his father with my hand refraining, seeing, watching him
die before he lived. One minute she was standing in the
door
I went to the dresser and took up the watch, with the
face still down. I tapped the crystal on the corner of the
dresser and caught the fragments of glass in my hand
and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands ofi and put them in the tray. The watch ticked on. I turned
the face up, the blank dial with httle wheels clicking and
clicking behind it, not knowing any better. Jesus walking on Galilee and Washington not telling lies. Father
brought back a watch-charm from the Saint Louis Fair
to Jason: a tiny opera glass into which you squinted with one eye and saw a skyscraper, a ferris wheel all spidery,
Niagara Falls on a pinhead. There was a red smear on
lOO THE SOUND AND THE FUE'T
the dial. When I saw it my thumb began to smart. I put
the watch down and went into Shreve s room and got the
iodine and painted the cut. I cleaned the rest of the glass
out of the rim with the towel.
I laid out two suits of underwear, with socks, shirts, collars and ties, and packed my trunk. I put in everything
except my new suit and an old one and two pairs
of shoes and two hats, and my books. I carried the books
into the sitting-room and stacked them on the table, the ones I had brought from home and the ones Father said
it used to be a gentleman was known by his books; nowadays
he is known by the ones he has not returned and
locked the trunk and addressed it. The quarter hour
sounded. I stopped and listened to it until tlie chimes
ceased.
I bathed and shaved. The water made my finger smart
a little, so I painted it again. I put on my new suit and
put my watch on and packed the other suit and the accessories
and my razor and brushes in my hand bag, and
wrapped the trunk key into a sheet of paper and put it in an envelope and addressed it to Father, and wrote the
two notes and sealed them.
The shadow hadn’t quite cleared the stoop. I stopped
inside the door, watching the shadow move. It moved al- most perceptibly, creeping back inside the door, driving
the shadow back into the door. Only she was running al- ready when 1 heard it. In the mirror she was running before
I knew what it was^ That quick, her train caught up
over her arm she ran out of the mirror like a cloud, her
veil swirling in long glints her heels brittle and fast clutching her dress onto her shoulder with the other
hand, running out of the mirror the smells roses roses the
voice that breathed o'er Eden. Then she was across the
porch I couldn't hear her heels then in the moonlight
THE SOUINTD AND THE FURY lOI
like a cloud, the floating shadow of the veil running
across the grass, into the bellowing. She ran out of her
dress, clutching her bridul, running into the bellowing
where T. P. in the dew Whooey Sassprilluh Benjy under

Shreve said, ‘Well, you didn’t. ... Is it a wedding or a wake?”
“I couldn’t make it,” I said. “Not with all that primping. What’s the matter? You
think this was Sunday?”
“I reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new
suit one time,” I said. “I was thinking about the Square students. Have you
got too proud to attend classes too?”
“I’m going to eat first.” The shadow on the stoop was
gone, I stepped into sunlight, finding my shadow again.
I walked down the steps just ahead of it. The half hour
went. Then the chimes ceased and died away.
Deacon wasn’t at the postoffice either. I stamped the
two envelopes and mailed the one to Father and put
Shreve’s in my inside pocket, and then I remembered
where I had last seen the Deacon. It was on Decoration
Day, in a G. A. R. uniform, in tlie middle of the parade.
If you waited long enough on any corner you would
see him in whatever parade came along. The one before was on Columbus’ or Garibaldi’s or somebody’s birthday.
He was in the Street Sweeper’s section, in a stovepipe
hat, carrying a two inch Itahan flag, smoking a cigar
among the brooms and scoops. But the last time was the
G. A. R. one, because Shreve said: “There now. Just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old nigger.”
“Yes,” I said, “Now he can spend day after day march-
102 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
ing in parades. If it hadn’t been for my grandfather, he’d
</interval><interval value=12 novelty=0.9133 residual=0.0702 level=high>have to work like whitefolks.”
I didn’t see him anywhere. But I never knew even a working nigger that you could find when you wanted
him, let alone one that lived off the fat of the land. A car came along. I went over to town and went to Parker’s and had a good breakfast. While I was eating I heard a
clock strike the hour. But then I suppose it takes at least one hour to lose time in, who has been longer than his- tory getting into the mechanical progression of it. 'When I finished breakfast I bought a cigar. The girl
^Siid a fifty cent one was the best, so I took one and lit it and went out to the street. I stood there and took a couple
of puffs, then I held it in my hand and went on to- ward the corner. I passed a jeweller’s window, but I looked away in time. At the corner two bootblacks
(,‘aught me, one on either side, shrill and raucous, like blackbirds. I gave the cigar to one of them, and the other one a nickel. Then they let me alone. The one with the
cigar was trying to sell it to the other for the nickel. There was a clock, high up in the sun, and I thought
about how, when you dont want to do a thmg, your
body will try to trick you into doing it, sort of unawares.
I could feel the muscles in the back of my neck, and
then I could hear my watch tickmg away in my pocket
and after a while I had all the other sounds shut away,
leaving only the watch in my pocket. I toned back up
the street, to the window. He was working at the table
behind the window. He was going bald. There was a
glass in his eye—a metal tube screwed into his face. I went in. The place was full of ticking, like crickets in September
grass, and I could hear a big clock on the wall above his head. He looked up, his eye big and blurred and rushing
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 103
beyond the glass. I took mine out and handed ft to him«
"I broke my watch.”
He flipped it over in his hand. “I should say you haver
You must have stepped on it.” ‘‘Yes, sir. I knocked it oflF the dresser and stepped on it in the dark. It’s still running though.”
He pried the back open and squinted into it. “Seems
to be all right. I cant tell until I go over it, though. Ill go into it this afternoon.”
“Ill bring it back later,” I said. “Would you mind tell- ing me if any of those watches in the window are right?”
He held my watch on his palm and looked up at me
with his blurred rushing eye.
“I made a bet with a fellow,” I said, “And I forgot my
glasses this morning.”
“Why, all right,” he said. He laid the watch down and
half rose on his stool and looked over the barrier. Then
he glanced up at the wall. “It’s twen
—
“Dont tell me,” I said, “please sir. Just tell me if any of them are right.”
He looked at me again. He sat back on the stool and
pushed the glass up onto his forehead. It left a red circle around his eye and when it was gone his whole face
looked naked. “What re you celebrating today?” he said,
“That boat race amt until next week, is it?” “No, sir. This is just a private celebration. Birthday.
Are any of them right?”
“No. But they haven’t been regulated and set yet. If you’re thinldng of buying one of them
—
“No, sir. I dont need a watch. We have a clock in our
sitting room. I’U have this one fixed when I do.” I reached my hand.
“Better leave it now.”
“I’ll bring it back later.” He gave me the watch. I put
104 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
it in my pocket. I couldnt hear it now, above all the
others. “I m much obliged to you. I hope I haven’t taken
up your time.”
''That’s all right. Bring it in when you are ready. And
you better put off this celebration until after we win that
boat race.” "Yes, sir. I reckon I had.”
I went out, shutting the door upon the ticking. I looked
back into the window. He was watching me across the
barrier. There were about a dozen watches in tlie window,
a dozen different hours and each with the same as- sertive and contradictory assurance that mine had, without
any hands at all. Contradicting one another. I could
hear mine, ticking away inside my pocket, even though
nobody could see it, even though it could tell nothing if anyone could. And so I told myself to take that one. Because Father
said clocks slay time. He said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock
stops does time come to life. The hands were extended,
slightly off tlie horizontal at a faint angle, like a gull
tilting into the wind. Holding all I used to be sorry about
like the new moon holding water, niggers say. The jeweller
was working again, bent over his bench, the tube
tunnelled into his face. His hair was parted in the center. The part ran up into the bald spot, like a drained marsh
in December.
I saw the hardware store from across the street. I didn’t know you bought flat-irons by the pound.
The clerk said, "These weigh ten pounds.” Only they were bigger than I thought. So I got two six-pound little ones, because they would look like a pair of shoes
wrapped up. They felt heavy enough together, but I
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 105
thought again how Father had said about the reducto ab- surdum of human experience, thinking how the only opportunity
I seemed to have for the application of Harvard.
Maybe by next year; thinking maybe it takes two
years in school to learn to do that properly.
But they felt heavy enough in the air. A street car came. I got on. I didn’t see the placard on the front. It was full, mostly prosperous looking people reading newspapers.
The only vacant seat was beside a nigger. He
wore a derby and shined shoes and he was holding a dead cigar stub. I used to think that a Southerner had to be always conscious of niggers. I thought that Northerners
would expect him to. When I first came East I kept
thinking You’ve got to remember to think of them as col- oured people not niggers, and if it hadn’t happened
that I wasn’t thrown with many of them. I’d have wasted
a lot of time and trouble before I learned that the best way to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they are, then leave them alone. That was when I realised that » nigger is not a person so much
as a form of behaviour; a sort of obverse reflection of the
white people he lives among. But I thought at first that
I ought to miss having a lot of them around me because
I thought that Northerners thought I did, but I didn’t know that I really had missed Roskus and Dilsey and
them until that morning in Virginia. The train was
stopped when I waked and I raised the shade and looked
out. The car was blocking a road crossing, where two
white fences came down a hill and then sprayed outward
and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn, and
there was a nigger on a mule in the middle of the stifl ruts, waiting for the train to move. How long he had
been there I didn’t know, but he sat straddle of the mule.
lo6 THE SOUN'D ANB THE FUBY
his head wrapped in a piece of blanket, as if they had
been built there with the fence and the road, or with the
hill, carved out of the hill itself, like a sign put there say- ing You are home again. He didn’t have a saddle and his feet dangled almost to the ground. The mule looked like a rabbit. I raised the window.
“Hey, Uncle,” I said, “Is this the way?”
“Suh?” He looked at me, then he loosened the blanket
and lifted it away from his ear. “Christmas gift!” I said. “Sho comin, boss. You done caught me, aint you?”
“rU let you oflE this time.” I dragged my pants out of the little hammock and got a quarter out. “But look out next time. Ill be coming back through here two days
after New Year, and look out then.” I threw the quarter
out the window. “Buy yourself some Santy Claus.”
“Yes, suh,” he said. He got down and picked up the
quarter and rubbed it on his leg. “Thanky, young marster.
Thanky.” Then the train began to move. I leaned
out the window, into the cold air, looking back. He stood
there beside the gaunt rabbit of a mule, the two of them
shabby and motionless and unimpatient. The train swung around the curve, the engine puffing with short,
heavy blasts, and they passed smoothly from sight that way, with that quahty about them of shabby and timeiess
patience, of static serenity: that blending of childlike and ready incompetence and paradoxical reliability that tends and protects them it loves out of all reason and
robs them steadily and evades responsibility and obligations
by means too barefaced to be called subterfuge even and is taken in theft or evasion with only that frank
and spontaneous admiration for the victor which a gentleman
feels for anyone who beats him in a fair contest.
THE SOUND AND THE THEY 107
and withal a fond and unflagging tolerance for whitefolks’
vagaries like that of a grandparent for unpredictable
and troublesome children, which I had forgotten.
And all that day, while the train wound through rushing
gaps and along ledges where movement was only a la- bouring sound of the exhaust and groaning wheels and
the eternal mountains stood fading into the thick sky,
I thought of home, of the bleak station and the mud and
the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the
square, with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out, and my insides would move like they used to do in school when the bell rang.
I wouldn’t begin counting until the clock struck three. Then I would begin, counting to sixty and folding down
one finger and thinking of the other fourteen fingers waiting
to be folded down, or thirteen or twelve or eight or seven, until all of a sudden I’d realise silence and the
unwinking minds, and I’d say ''Ma’am?” "Your name is Quentin, isn’t it?” Miss Laura said. Then more silence and
the cruel unwinking minds and hands jerking into the
silence. "Tell Quentin who discovered the Mississippi
River, Henry.” "DeSoto.” Then the minds would go
away, and after a while I’d be afraid I had gotten behind
and I’d count fast and fold down another finger,
then I’d be afraid I was going too fast and I’d slow up,
then I’d get afraid and count fast again. So</interval><interval value=13 novelty=0.9324 residual=0.0902 level=high> I never could come out even with the hell, and the released surging of feet moving already, feehng earth in the scuffed floor, and the day like a pane of glass struck a hght, sharp
blow, and my insides would move, sitting still. Moving
sitting still. One minute she was standing in the door. Benjy. Bellowing. Benjamin the child of mine old age
bellowing. Caddy! Caddy!

What he want to worry about luck for? Luck cant do

The street car stopped, started, stopped again. Below
the window I watched the crowns of people's heads pass- ing beneath new straw hats not yet unbleached. There
were women in the car now, wititi market baskets, and men in work-clothes were beginning to outnumber the
shined shoes and collars. The nigger touched my laiee. “Pardon me," he said. I swung my legs out and let him pass. We were going beside
a blank wall, the sound clattering back into the car, at the women with market baskets on their knees and a man in a stained hat "with a pipe stuck in the band. I could smell water, and in a break in the wall I saw a
glint of water and two masts, and a gull motionless in midair, like on an invisible wire between the masts, and
I raised my hand and through my coat touched the letters I had written. When the car stopped I got ofiF. The bridge was open to let a schooner through. She was in tow, the tug nudging along under her quarter,
trailing smoke, but the ship herself was like she was moving
without visible means. A man naked to the waist was
coiling down a line on the fo’c's'le head. His body was
burned the colour of leaf tobacco. Another man in a
straw hat without any crown was at the wheel. The ship
THE SOIJHD AND THE FUEY 109
went through the bridge, moving under bare poles like a ghost in broad day, with three gulls hovering above the
stern like toys on invisible wires. When it closed I crossed to the other side and leaned on the rail above the boathouses. The float was empty
and the doors were closed. The crew just pulled in the
late afternoon now, resting up before. The shadow
of the bridge, the tiers of railing, my shadow leaning flat upon the water, so easily had I tricked it that it would not
quit me. At least fifty feet it was, and if I only had something
to blot it into the water, holding it until it was
drowned, the shadow of the package like two shoes
wrapped up lying on the water. Niggers say a drowned
man s shadow was watching for him in the water all the
time. It twinkled and glinted, like breathing, the float slow like breathing too, and debris half submerged, heal- ing out to the sea and the caverns and the grottoes of the sea. The displacement of water is equal to the something
of something. Reducto absurdum of all human ex- perience, and two six-pound flat-irons weigh more than one tailor s goose. What a sinful waste Dilsey would say. Benjy knew it when Damuddy died. He cried. He smell
hit. He smelt hit. The tug came back downstream, the water shearing in long rolling cylinders, rocking the float at last with the
echo of passage, the float lurching onto the rolling cylinder
with a plopping sound and a long jarring noise as the
door rolled back and two men emerged, carrying a shell. They set it in the water and a moment later Bland came
out, with the sculls. He wore flannels, a grey jacket and a
stiff straw hat. Either he or his mother had read some- where that Oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats, so early one March they bought Gerald a one pair
shell and in his flannels and stiff hat he went on the river.
no THE SOUND AND THE FURY
The folks at the boathouses threatened to call a policeman,
but he went anyway. His mother came down in a
hired auto, in a fur suit like an arctic explorer s, and saw
him ojff in a twenty-five mile wind and a steady drove of
ice floes like dirty sheep. Ever since then I have believed
that God is not only a gentleman and a sport; He
is a Kentuckian too. When he sailed away she made a detour and came down to the river again and drove
along parallel with him, the car in low gear. They said
you couldn t have told they’d ever seen one another before,
like a King and Queen, not even looking at one another,
just moving side by side across Massachusetts on
parallel courses like a couple of planets.
He got in and pulled away. He pulled pretty well now. He ought to. They said his mother tried to make him
give rowing up and do something else the rest of his class couldn’t or wouldn’t do, but for once he was stubborn.
If you could call it stubbornness, sitting in his attitudes
of princely boredom, with his curly yellow hair and his
violet eyes and his eyelashes and his New York clothes,
while his mamma was telling us about Gerald’s horses
and Gerald’s niggers and Gerald’s women. Husbands and
fathers in Kentucky must have been awful glad when she
carried Gerald off to Cambridge. She had an apartment
over in town, and Gerald had one there too, besides his rooms in college. She approved of Gerald associating
with me because I at least revealed a blundering sense of noblesse oblige by getting myself born below Mason and
Dixon, and a few others whose geography met the re- quirements (minimum) Forgave, at least. Or condoned.
But since she met Spoade coming out of chapel one He
said she couldn’t be a lady no lady would be out at that
hour of the night she never had been able to forgive him
for having five names, including that of a present Eng-

lish ducal house. Tm sure she solaced herself by being
convinced that some misfit Maingault or Mortemar had
got mixed up with the lodge-keeper s daughter. Which
was quite probable, whether she invented it or not. Spoade was the world's champion sitter-a-round, no
holds barred and gouging discretionary.
The shell was a speck now, the oars catching the sun
in spaced glints, as if the hull were winking itself along,
Did you ever have a sister? No but they're all bitches. Did you ever have a sister? One minute she was. Bitches,

And after a while I had been hearing my watch for some time and I could feel the letters crackle thi'ough my
coat, against the railing, and I leaned on the railings
watching my shadow, how I had tricked it. I moved
along the rail, but my suit was dark too and I could
wipe my hands, watching my shadow, how I had tricked

"I want to see you a minute,” I said, stopping.
"See me? All right. See you again, fellows,” he said,
stopping and turning back; "glad to have chatted with
you.” That was the Deacon, all over. Talk about your nat- ural psychologists. They said he hadn’t missed a train at the beginning of school in forty years, and that he could
pick out a Southerner with one glance. He never missed,
and once he had heard you speak, he could name your
state. He had a regular uniform he met trains in, a sort of Uncle Tom’s cabin outfit, patches and all. "Yes, suh. Right dis way, young marster, hyer we is,” taking your bags. "Hyer, boy, come hyer and git dese
grips.” Whereupon a moving mountain of luggage would
edge up, revealing a white boy of about fifteen, and the
Deacon would hang another bag on him somehow and
drive him off. "Now, den, dont you drap hit. Yes, suh,

what it meant he was so taken with it tliat he be^ gan to retail the story himself, until at last he must come
to believe he really had. Anyway he related long point'
less anecdotes of his undergraduate days, speaking fami?-
iarly of dead and departed professors by their first names,
usually incorrect ones. But he had been guide mentot
and friend to unnumbered crops of innocent and lonely
freshmen, and I suppose that with all his petty chicanery
and hypocrisy he stank no higher in heaven’s nostrils than
any other. "'Haven’t seen you in three-four days,” he said, staring
at me from his still military aura. "You been sick?” "No. I’ve been all right. Working, I reckon. I’ve seen
you, though.”
. "Yes?”
"In the parade the other day.”
"Oh, that. Yes, I was there. I dont care nothing about
that sort of thing, you understand, but the boys likes to have me with them, the vet’runs does. Ladies wants all the old vet’mns to turn out, you know. So I has to oblige
them.”
"And on that Wop holiday too,” I said. "You were obliging

Then see where I’m marching. I wont need to tell you
how I’m fixing it; I say, just wait and see, my boy.” He
looked at me now and clapped me lightly on the shoul- der and rocked back on his heels, nodding at me. "Yes,

took the letter from my pocket. "Take this around to my room tomorrow and give it to Shreve. He’ll have something for you. But not till tomorrow, mind.”
He took the letter and examined it. "It’s sealed up.”
"Yes. And it’s written inside, Not good until to- morrow.”
"H’m,” he said. He looked at the envelope, his mouth
pursed. "Something for me, you say?”
"Yes. A present I’m making you.”
He was looking at me now, the envelope white in his black hand, in the sun. His eyes were soft and irisless and
brown, and suddenly I saw Roskus watching me from
behind aU his whitefolks’ claptrap of uniforms and politics

'You know I’m not. Did any Southerner ever play a

more he was that self he had long since taught himself
to wear in the world’s eye, pompous, spurious, not quite

"I’ve tried to treat all folks right,” he said. "I draw no
petty social lines. A man to me is a man, wherever I find him.”
"I hope you’ll always find as many friends as you ve
made.”
"Young fellows. I get along with them. They dont for- get me, neither,” he said, waving the envelope. He put it into his pocket and buttoned his coat. "Yes, sir,” he said, "I’ve had good friends.” The chimes began again, the half hour. I stood in the
belly of my shadow and hstened to the strokes spaced
and tranquil along the sunlight, among the thin, still httle leaves. Spaced and peaceful and serene, with that quality of autumn always in bells even in the month of brides.

Even sound seemed to fail in this air, like the air was worn out with carrying sounds so long. A dogs voice carries
further than a train, in the darkness anyway. And
some people’s. Niggers. Louis Hatcher never even used his horn carrying it and that old lantern. I said, '‘Louis, when
was the last time you cleaned that lantern?”
“I cleant hit a little while back. You member when
all dat flood-watter wash dem folks away up yonder? I cleant hit dat ve’y day. Old woman and me settin fore de fire dat night and she say 'Louis, whut you gwine do ef dat flood git out dis fur?’ and I say 'Dat’s a fack. I reckon
I had better clean dat lantun up.’ So I cleaht hit dat
night.”
"That flood was way up in Pennsylvania,” I said. "It couldn’t even have got down this far.” "Dat’s whut you says,” Louis said. "Watter kin git des ez high en wet in Jefferson ez hit kin in Pennsylvaney, I reckon. Hit’s de folks dat says de high watter cant git dis fur dat comes floatin out on de ridge-pole, too.” "Did you and Martha get out that night?”
"We done jest that. I cleant dat lantun and me and her

"You mean, until another flood comes along?”
"Hit kep us outen dat un.” "Oh, come on, Uncle Louis,” I said. "Yes, suh. You do you way en I do mine. Ef all I got td do to keep outen de high watter is to clean dis yere

"Unc’ Louis wouldn’t ketch nothin wid a light he could

"'Yes, suh,” Louis said, "I got plenty light fer possums to

Hum awn, dawg.” And we'd sit in the dry leaves that whispered a Httle with the slow res- piration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless October, the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air, listening to the dogs
and to the echo of Louis' voice dying away. He never
raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our
front porch. When he called the dogs in he sounded just
like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never
used, but clearer, mellower, as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence, coihng out of it, coiling into
it again. WhoOoooo. WhoOoooo. WhoOooooooooooooooo.

I began to feel the water before I came to the bridge.
The bridge was of grey stone, lichened, dappled with
slow moisture where the fungus crept. Beneath it the
water was clear and still in the shadow, whispering and
clucking about the stone in fading swirls of spinning sky.
Caddy that Tve got to marry somebody Versh told me about a man
mutilated himself. He went into the woods and did it vdth a razor, sitting in a ditch. A broken razor, flinging

them backward over his shoulder the same motion complete
the jerked skein of blood backward not looping.
But thafs not it. It's not not having them. It's never to have had them then I could say O That That's Chinese
I dont know Chinese. And Father said it's because you
are a virgin: dont you see? Women are never virgins. Purity
is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature,
It's nature is hurting you not Caddy and I said That's just
words and he said So is virginity and I said you dont
know. You cant know and he said Yes. On the instant when we come to reahse that tragedy is second-hand.
Where the shadow of the bridge fell I could see down for a long way, but not as far as the bottom. When
you leave a leaf in water a long time after awhile the
tissue will be gone and the delicate fibers waving slow as the motion of sleep. They dont touch one another, no
matter how knotted up they once were, no matter how
close they lay once to the bones. And maybe when He
says Rise the eyes will come floating up too, out of the
deep quiet and the sleep, to look on glory. And after awhile the flat irons would come floating up. I hid them
under the end of the bridge and went back and leaned on the rail. I could not see the bottom, but I could see a long way
into the motion of the water before the eye gave out, and
then I saw a shadow hanging like a fat arrow stemming
into the current. Mayflies skimmed in and out of the
shadow of the bridge just above the surface. If it could
fust be a hell beyond that: the clean flame the two of us more than dead. Then you will have only me then only
me then the two of us amid the pointing and the horror

phant picking up a peanut. The fading vortex drifted
away down stream and then I saw the arrow again, nose
into the current, wavering delicately to the motion of the
water above which the Mayflies slanted and poised. Only
you and me then amid the pointing and the horror walled
hy the clean -flame The trout hung, delicate and motionless among the
wavering shadows. Three boys with fishing poles came
onto the bridge and we leaned on the rail and looked
down at the trout. They knew the fish. He was a neighbourhood
character. ''TheyVe been trying to catch that trout for twenty-five
years. There’s a store in Boston offers a twenty-five dollar
fishing rod to anybody that can catch him.”
"Why dont you all catch him, then? Wouldnt you like
to have a twenty-five dollar fishing rod?”
"Yes,” they said. They leaned on the rail, looking
down at the trout. "I sure would,” one said. "I wouldnt take the rod,” the second said. "Td take the
money instead.” "Maybe they wouldnt do that,” the first said. "I bet
he’d make you take the rod.” "Then I’d seU it.” "You couldnt get twenty-five dollars for it,’' 'Td take what I could get, then. I can catch just as many fish with this pole as I could with a twenty-five dollar
one.” Then they talked about what they would do
with twenty-five dollars. They all talked at once, their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient, making
of unreahty a possibility, then a probabihty, then an in- controvertible fact, as people will when their desires be- come words.
"I’d buy a horse and wagon,” the second said. ^Tes you would,” the others said.

dollars. I know the man.'’ "Who is it?" "That's all right who it is. I can buy it for twenty-five
dollars.” "Yah,” th</interval><interval value=18 novelty=0.8647 residual=0.027 level=normal>e others said, "He dont know any such thing.
He's just talking.”
"Do you think so?” the boy said. They continued to jeer at him, but he said nothing more. He leaned on the
rail, looking down at the trout which he had already
spent, and suddenly the acrimony, the conflict, was gone
from their voices, as if to them too it was as though he
had captured the fish and bought his horse and wagon,
they too partaking of that adult trait of being convinced
of anything by an assumption of silent superiority. I sup'
pose that people, using themselves and each other so much by words, are at least consistent in attributing wisdom
to a still tongue, and for a while I could feel the
other two seeking swiftly for some means by which to cope with him, to rob him of his horse and wagon.
"You couldnt get twenty-five dollars for that pole,” the
first said. "I bet anything you couldnt.” "He hasnt caught that trout yet,” the third said sud- denly, then they both cried: 'Tah, wha'd I tell you? What's the man's name? I dare
you to tell. There aint any such man.”
"Ah, shut up,” the second said. "Look, Here he comes
again.” They leaned on the rail, motionless, identical, their poles slanting slenderly in the sunlight, also identic
cal. The trout rose without haste, a shadow in faint waw
ering increase; again the little vortex faded slowly downstream.
"Gee,” the first one murmured.
‘We dont try to catch him anymore,” he said. ‘We
just watch Boston folks that come out and try.”
X38 the sound and the fuby
"Is he the only fish in this pool?’^ "Yes. He ran all the others out. The best place to fish around here is down at the Eddy."'
"No it aint," the second said. "It’s better at Bigelow’s
Mill two to one.” Then they argued for a while about
which was the best fishing and then left off all of a sudden
to watch the trout rise again and the broken swirl
of water suck down a little of the sky. I asked how far it was to the nearest town. They told me.
"But the closest car line is that way,” the second said,
pointing back down the road. "Where are you going?”
"Nowhere. Just walking.”
"Tfou from the college?”
'Yes. Are there any factories in that town?”
"Factories?” They looked at me.
"No,” the second said. "Not there.” They looked at my
clothes. 'You looking for work?”
"How about Bigelov/s Mill?” the third said. "That’s a
factory.”
"Factory my eye. He means a sure enough factory.”
"One with a whistle,” I said. "I havent heard any one
oclock whistles yet.”
"Oh,” the second said. "There’s a clock in the Unitarian
steeple. You can find out the time from that. Havent you
got a watch on that chain?”
"I broke it this morning.” I showed them my watch.
They examined it gravely.
"It’s still running,” the second said. "What does a watch
like that cost?”
"It wns a present,” I said. "My father gave it to me
when I graduated from high school.” “Are you a Canadian?” the third said. He had red hair. "Canadian?”

"'He dont talk like them ” the second said. "IVe heard
them talk. He talks like they do in minstrel shows.’’ "Say,” the third said, "aint you afraid he’ll hit you?”
"Hit me?”
"You said he talks like a coloured man.”
""Ah, dry up,” the second said. ""You can see the steeple
when you get over that hill there.”
I thanked them. ""I hope you have good luck. Only
dont catch that old fellow down there. He deserves to be
let alone.”
""Cant anybody catch that fish,” the first said. They
leaned on the rail, looking down into the water, the three
poles Hke three slanting threads of yellow fire in the sun.
I walked upon my shadow, tramping it into the dappled
shade of trees again. The road curved, mounting
away from the water. It crossed the hill, then descended
winding, carrying the eye, the mind on ahead beneath a
still green tunnel, and the square cupola above the trees and the round eye of the clock but far enough. I sat down at the roadside. The grass was ankle deep, myriad.
The shadows on the road were as still as if they had been
put there with a stencil, with slanting pencils of sunlight.
But it was only a train, and after a while it died away beyond
the trees, the long sound, and then I could hear my
watch and the train dying away, as tliough it were run- ning through another month or another summer somewhere,
rushing away under the poised gull and all things
rushing. Except Gerald. He would be sort of grand too,
pulling in lonely state across the noon, rowing himself

Their voices came over the hill, and the three slender
poles like balanced threads of running fire. They looked
at me passing, not slowing.
'Well,’’ I said, "I dont see him.”
'We didnt try to catch him,” the first said. "You cant catch that fish.” "There’s the clock,” the second said, pointing. "You can
teU the time when you get a little closer.” "Yes,” I said, "All right.” I got up. "You all going to tovm?”
'"^Ve’re going to the Eddy for chub,” the first said. "You cant catch anything at the Eddy,” the second
said. "I guess you want to go to the mill, with a lot of fel- lows splashing and scaring all the fish away.”
"You cant catch any fish at the Eddy.”
"We wont cafrh none nowhere if we dont go on,” the
third said, "I dont see why you keep on talking about the Eddy,”
the second said. "You cant catch anything there.” "You dont have go,” the first said. "You’re not tied to me.
"Let’s go to the mill and go swimming,” the third said. "I’m going to the Eddy and fish,” the first said. "You
can do as you please
”
"Say, how long has it been since you heard of anybody
catching a fish at tb^" Eddy?” the second said to the
third. "Let’s go to the mill and go swimming,” the third said. The cupola sank slowly beyond the trees, with the round
face of the clock far enough yet. We went on in the dap-

"'Let’s go to the mill and go swimming,” the third said,
A lane turned off beside the orchard. The third boy
slowed and halted. The first went on, flecks of sunlight
slipping along the pole across his shoulder and down the
back of his shirt. "Come on,” the third said. The second
boy stopped too. Why must you marry somebody Caddy

"Let’s go up to the mill,” he said. "Come on.” The first boy went on. His bare feet made no sound,
falling softer than leaves in the thin dust. In the orchard
the bees sounded like a wind getting up, a sound caught
by a spell just under crescendo and sustained. The lane
went along the wall, arched over, shattered with bloom,
dissolving into trees. Sunlight slanted into it, sparse and
eager. Yellow butterflies flickered along the shade like flecks of sun. "What do you want to go to the Eddy for?” the second
boy said. "Tou can fish at the mill if you want to.” "Ah, let him go,” the third said. They looked after the
first boy. Sunlight slid patchily across his walking shoulders,
glinting along the pole hke yellow ants. "Kenny,” tibe second said. Say it to Father will you I

looked after the first boy. "Yah,” they said suddenly, "go on then, mamma’s boy. If he goes swimming he’ll get his head wet and then he’ll get a licking.” They turned into the lane and went on, the yellow butterflies slanting aboul

\igh and clear and small in the neat obscurity above the
door, as though it were gauged and tempered to make
that single clear small sound so as not to wear the bell out nor to require the expenditure of too much silence in restoring it when the door opened upon the recent warm
scent of baking; a little dirty child with eyes like a toy
bears and two patent-leather pig-tails.
“Hello, sister.” Her face was hke a cup of milk dashed
with coffee in the sweet warm emptiness. “Anybody
here?”
But she merely watched me until a door opened and
the lady came. Above the counter where the ranks of crisp shapes behind the glass her neat grey face her
hair tight and sparse from her neat grey skull, spectacles
in neat grey rims riding approaching like something on a
wire, like a cash box in a store. She looked like a librarian. Something among dusty shelves of ordered certitudes
long divorced from reality, desiccating peacefully, as if a breath of that air which sees injustice done
“Two of these, please, ma’am.”
From under the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper and laid it on the counter and lifted the two buns out. The little girl watched them with still and unwinking eyes like two currants floating motionless
in a cup of weak coffee Land of the kike home of the
wop. Watching the bread, the neat grey hands, a broad
gold band on the left forefinger, knuckled there by a blue
knuckle.
“Do you do your own baking, ma’am?”
“Sir?” she said. Like that. Sir? Like on the stage Sir? “Five cents. Was there anything else?” “No, ma’am. Not for me. This lady wants something.”
She was not tall enough to see over ihe case, so she went
THE SOUND AND THE FURY
to the end of the counter and looked at the little girl ‘‘Did you bring her in here?’’ “No, ma’am. She was here when I came.”
“You little wretch,” she said. She came out around
the counter, but she didnt touch the little girl. “Have yoii
got anything in your pockets?”
“She hasnt got any pockets,” I said. “She wasnt doing
anything. She was standing here, waiting for you.”
“Why didnt the bell ring, then?” She glared at me. She
just needed a bunch of switches, a blackboard behind
her 2 X 2 e 5. “She’ll hide it under her dress and a body’d never know it. You, child. How’d you get in here?’’ The little girl said nothing. She looked at the woman,
then she gave me a flying black glance and looked at the woman again, “Them foreigners,” the woman said. “How’d she get in without the bell ringing?”
“She came in when I opened the door,” I said. “It rang once for both of us. She couldnt reach anything from
here, anyway. Besides, I dont think she would. Would
you, sister?” The little girl looked at me, secretive, contemplative.
“What do you want? bread?”
She extended her fist. It uncurled upon a nickel, moist
and dirty, moist dirt ridged into her flesh. The coin was damp and warm. I could smell it, faintly metallic. “Have you got a five cent loaf, please, ma’am?”
From beneath the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper sheet and laid it on the counter and
wrapped a loaf into it. I laid the coin and another one on 4e counter. “And another one of those buns, please,
ma’am.”
She took another bun from the case. “Give me tha^ parcel,” she said. I gave it to her and she unwrapped iC and put the third bun in and wrapped it and took the
C4^ THE SOUND AND THE EUEY
coins and found two coppers in her apron and gave them
to me. I handed them to the little girl. Her fingers closed
about them, damp and hot, like worms.
''You going to give her that bun?’’ the woman said. "Yessum,” I said. '1 expect your cooking smells as good
to her as it does to me.”
I took up the two packages and gave the bread to the
little girl, the woman all hon-grey behind the counter,
watching us with cold certitude. "You wait a minute,”
she said. She went to the rear. The door opened again
and closed. The little girl watched me, holding the bread
against her dirty-dress.
"What’s your name?” I said. She quit looking at me,
but she was still motionless. She didnt even seem to breathe. The woman returned. She had a funny looking
thing in her hand. She carried it sort of like it might
have been a dead pet rat. "Here,” she said. The child looked at her. "Take it,” the woman said, jabbing it at the little girl. "It just looks
peculiar. I calculate you wont know the difference when
you eat it. Here. I cant stand here all day.” The child
took it, still watching her. The woman rubbed her hands on her apron. "I got to have that bell fixed,” she said. She went to the door and jerked it open. The little bell tinkled once, faint and clear and invisible. We moved
toward the door and the woman’s peering back.
"Thank you for the cake,” I said. "Them foreigners,” she said, staring up into the obscurity
where the bell tinkled. "Take my advice and stay
clear of them, young man.”
"Yessum,” I said. "Come on, sister.” We went out. “Thank you, ma’am.”
She swung the door to, then jerked it open again, mak-

she said, peering up at the bell. We went on. "Well,'" I said, "How about some ic^ cream?” She was eating the gnarled cake. "Do you hke
ice cream?” She gave me a black still look, chewing.
"'Come on.” We came to the drugstore and had some ice cream. She wouldn't put the loaf down. "Why not put it down
so you can eat better?” I said, offering to take it. But she
held to it, chewing the ice cream like it was taffy. The
bitten cake lay on the table. She ate the ice cream steadily,
then she fell to on the cake again, looking about at the showcases. I finished mine and we went out. "Which way do you live?” I said. A buggy, the one with the horse it was. Only Doc Pea- body is fat. Three hundred pounds. You ride with him or

her throat. I opened my package and gave her one of the buns. "'Goodbye/' I said.
I went on. Then I looked back. She was behind me.
"‘Do you live down this way?'' She said nothing. She
ivalked beside me, under my elbow sort of, eating. We
went on. It was quiet, hardly anyone about getting the
odour of honeysuckle all mixed She would have told me
not to let me sit there on the steps hearing her door twilight
slamming hearing Benjy still crying Supper she
would have to come down then getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it We reached the corner. "Well, iVe got to go down this way,” I said, "Goodbye.”
She stopped too. She swallowed the last of the cake,
then she began on the bun, watching me across it. "Goodbye,”
I said. I turned into the street and went on, but I went to the next corner before I stopped.
"Which way do you live?” I said. "This way?” I pointed
down the street. She just looked at me. "Do you hve over
that way? I bet you live close to the station, where the
trains are. Dont you?” She just looked at me, serene and
secret and chewing. The street was empty both ways,
with quiet lawns and houses neat among the trees, but no one at all except back there. We turned and went
back. Two men sat in chairs in front of a store. "Do you all know this little girl? She sort of took up
with me and I cant find where she lives.” ^ They quit looking at me and looked at her. "Must be one of them new Italian families,” one said,
He wore a rusty frock coat. "Tve seen her before. What's
your name, little girl?” She looked at them blackly for awhile, her jaws moving steadily. She swallowed without
ceasing to chew.
"Mavbe she cant sneak English.” the other said.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 149
"They sent her after bread,” I said. “She must be able
to speak something.”
^Whats your pas name?” the first said. “Pete? Joe? name John huh?” She took another bite from the bun.
‘What must I do with her?” I said. “She just follows me. IVe got to get back to Boston.”
"You from the college?”
"Yes, sir</interval><interval value=20 novelty=0.8413 residual=0.0054 level=normal>. And IVe got to get on back.”
"You might go up the street and turn her over to Anse,
He'll be up at the Uvery stable. The marshall.”
"I reckon that’s what 111 have to do,” I said. "IVe got
to do something with her. Much obliged. Come on, sister.” We went up the street, on the shady side, where the shadow of the broken facade blotted slowly across the
road. We came to the livery stable. The marshall wasnt
there. A man sitting in a chair tilted in the broad low
door, where a dark cool breeze smelling of ammonia
blew among the ranked stalls, said to look at the postoflSce.
He didn’t know her either. "Them furriners. I cant tell one from another. You
might take her across the tracks where they live, and
maybe somebody’ll claim her.” We went to the postofiBce. It was back down the street The man in the frock coat was opening a newspaper.
"Anse just drove out of town,” he said, "I guess you’d
better go down past the station and walk past them
houses by the river. Somebody there’ll know her.”
"I guess I’ll have to,” I said. "Come on, sister.” She
pushed the last piece of the bun into her mouth and swallowed
it, "Want another?” I said. She looked at me, chewing,
her eyes black and unwinking and friendly. I took
the other two buns out and gave her one and bit into the
other. I asked a man where the station was and he
showed me, "Come on, sister.”
ISO THE SOXJHD AND THE FtJEY
We reached the station and crossed the tracks, where
die river was. A bridge crossed it, and a street of jumbled
frame houses followed the river, backed onto it. A
shabby street, but with an air heterogeneous and vivid
too. In the center of an untrimmed plot enclosed by a
fence of gaping and broken pickets stood an ancient lopsided
surrey and a weathered house from an upper window
of which hung a garment of vivid pink.
''Does that look like your house?” I said. She looked
at me over the bun. "This one?” I said, pointing. She just
chewed, but it seemed to me that I discerned something
aflBrmative, acquiescent even if it wasn’t eager, in her air. ‘'This one?” I said. "Come on, then.” I entered the broken
gate. I looked back at her. "Here?” I said. "This look like your house?”
She nodded her head rapidly, looking at me, gnawing
into the damp halfmoon of the bread. We went on. A
walk of broken random flags, speared by fresh coarse blades of grass, led to the broken stoop. There was no movement about the house at all, and the pink garment
hanging in no wind from the upper window. There was
a bell pull with a porcelain knob, attached to about six feet of wire when I stopped pulling and knocked. The
little girl had the crust edgeways in her chewing mouth.
A woman opened the door. She looked at me, then she
spoke rapidly to the little girl in Italian, with a rising inflection,
then a pause, interrogatory. She spoke to her
again, the little girl looking at her across the end of the
crust, pushing it into her mouth with a dirty hand.
"She says she lives here,” I said. "I met her down town.
Is this your bread?”
"No spika,” the woman said. She spoke to the little girl
again. The little girl just looked at her.
THE SOXJKD AND THE FUEY 15I
^'No live here?'' I said. I pointed to the girl, then at her,
then at the door. The woman shook her head. She spoke
rapidly. She came to the edge of the porch and pointed
down the road, speaking.
I nodded violently too. ""You come show?” I said. I took
her arm, waving my other hand toward the road. She
spoke swiftly, pointing. "Ton come show,” I said, trying
to lead her down the steps.
"Si, si,” she said, holding back, showing me whatever
it was, I nodded again.
"Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.” I went down the steps and
walked toward the gate, not running, but pretty fast. I reached the gate and stopped and looked at her for a
while. The crust was gone now, and she looked at me
with her black, friendly stare. The woman stood on the stoop, watching us. "Come on, then,” I said. "We'll have to iBnd ihe right one sooner or later.” She moved along just under my elbow. We went on. The houses all seemed empty. Not a soul in sight. A sort of breathlessness that empty houses have. Yet they
couldnt all be empty. All the different rooms, if you
could just slice the walls away all of a sudden Madam^
your daughter, if you please. No. Madam, for God’s sake,
your daughter. She moved along just under my elbow^
her shiny tight pigtails, and then the last house played out and the road curved out of sight beyond a wall, following
the river. The woman was emerging from the broken
gate, with a shawl over her head and clutched under her
chin. The road curved on, empty. I found a coin and
gave it to the little girl. A quarter, ""Goodbye, sister,” 1 said. Then I ran.
I ran fast, not looking back. Just before the road curved
1)Z THE SOUND AND THE EUEY
away I looked back. She stood in the road, a small figure
clasping the loaf of bread to her filthy little dress, her
eyes still and black and unwinking. I ran on. A lane turned from the road. I entered it and after a
while I slowed to a fast walk. The lane went between
back premises—^uupainted houses with more of those gay
and startling coloured garments on lines, a barn brokenbacked,
decaying quietly among rank orchard trees, unpruned and weedchoked, pink and white and murmurous
with sunlight and with bees. I looked back. The en- trance to the lane was empty. I slowed still more, my
shadow pacing me, dragging its head through the weeds
that hid the fence. The lane went back to a barred gate, became defunctive
in grass, a mere path scarred quietly into new glass.
I climbed the gate into a woodlot and crossed it and came to another wall and followed that one, my shadow
behind me now. There were vines and creepers where
at home would be honeysuckle. Coming and coming es- pecially in the dusk when it rained, getting honeysuckle
all mixed up in it as though it were not enough without
that, not unbearable enough. What did you let him for
kiss kiss I didnt let him I made him watching me getting mad
What do you think of that? Red print of my hand coming
up through her face like turning a light on under your

the. Grass sticks crisscrossed into the flesh tinging scour- ing her head. Say calf rope say it I didnt kiss a dirty girl like Natalie anyway The wall
went into shadow, and then my shadow, I had tricked it again. I had forgot about the river curving along the
road. I climbed the wall. And then she watched me jump
down, holding the loaf against her dress.
I stood in the weeds and we looked at one another for a while.
"Why didnt you tell me you lived out this way, sister?’' The loaf was wearing slowly out of the paper; already it needed a new one. "Well, come on then and show me the house.” not a dirty girl like Natalie. It was raining we
could hear it on the roof, sighing through the high sweet
emptiness of the barn. There? touching her
Not there
There? not raining hard hut we couldnt hear anything
but the roof and as if it was my blood or her blood
She pushed me down the bidder and ran off and left me Caddy did
Was it there it htiH you when Caddy did ran off was it there
Oh She walked just under my elbow, the top of her
patent leather head, the loaf fraying out of the newS"
paper.
""If you dont get home pretty soon you re going to wear
that loaf out. And then whatll your mamma say?” I bet
I can lift you up
You cant Tm too heavy
Did Caddy go away did she go to the house you cant see the barn from our house did you ever try to see the

It was her fault she pushed me she ran away
154 THE SOUHD AND THE FUEY
I can lift you up see how 1 can oh her blood or my blood Oh We went on in the thin
dust, our feet silent as rubber in the thin dust where pencils
of sun slanted in the trees. And I could feel water
again running swift and peaceful in the secret shade.
'Tou live a long way, dont you. You re mighty smart to go this far to town by yourself.'’ It's like dancing sitting
down did you ever dance sitting down? We could hear
the rain, a rat in the crib, the empty barn vacant with
horses. How do you hold to dance do you hold like this Oh
I used to hold like this you thought I wasnt strong
r^nough didn't you
Oh Oh Oh Oh
I hold to use like this I mean did you hear what I said
I said
oh oh oh oh
The road went on, still and empty, the sun slanting more and more. Her stiff little pigtails were bound at the
tips with bits of crimson cloth. A comt?r of the wrapping
flapped a little as she walked, the nose of the loaf naked.
I stopped.
^Xook here. Do you live down this road? We havent
passed a house in a mile, almost." She looked at me, black and secret and friendly.
‘"Where do you live, sister? Dont you live back there in town?"
There was a bird somewhere in the woods, beyond the
broken and infrequent slanting of sunlight.
“Your papas going to be worried about you. Dont you
reckon youll get a whipping for not coming straight home
with that bread?"
The bird whistled again, invisible, a sound meaningless
and profound, inflexionless, ceasing as though cut off

with the blow of a knife, and again, and that sense ol water swift and peaceful above secret places, felt, not seen not heard.
'"Oh, hell, sister.” About half the paper hung limp. “That's not doing any good now.” I tore it oflE and
dropped it beside the road. '‘Come on. Well have to go
back to town. Well go back along the river.” We left the road. Among the moss little pale flowers grew, and the sense of water mute and unseen. 1 hold to use like this I mean I use to hold She stood in the door

They saw us from the water first, heads and shoulders. They yelled and one rose squatting and sprang among
them. They looked like beavers, the water lipping about
their chins, yelling. ''Take that girl away! What did you want to bring a
girl here for? Go on awayr^"
"She wont hurt you. We just want to watch you for a
while.” They squatted in the water. Their heads drew into a
clump, watching us, then they broke and rushed toward
us, hurling water with their hands. We moved quick.
"Look out, boys; she wont hurt you.”
"Go on away, Harvard!” It was the second boy, the one
that thought the horse and wagon back there at the
bridge. "Splash them, fellows!”
"Let’s get out and throw them in,” another said. "I aint
afraid of any girl.”
"Splash them! Splash them!” They rushed toward us, hurling water. We moved back. "Go on away!” they
yelled. "Go on away!”
We went away. They huddled just under the bank,
their shck heads in a row against the bright water. We
went on. "That’s not for us, is it.” The sun slanted through

to the moss here and there, leveller. "Poor kid, you’re just a girl.” Little flowers grew among the moss, littler than 1 had ever seen. "You’re just a girl. Poor kid.” There v/as a
path, curving along beside the water. Then the water was
still again, dark and still and swift. "Nothing but a girl
Poor sister.” We lay in the wet grass panting the rain like cold shot on my bach Do you care now do you do you

her black, secret, friendly gaze, the half-naked loaf clutched to her breast. "It’s wet. I thought we jumped
back in time.” I took my handkerchief and tried to wipe
^he loaf, but the crust began to come off, so I stopped.
'We’ll just have to let it dry itself. Hold it like this.” She
held it like that. It looked kind of like rats had been eat- ing it now. and the water building and building up the

Then we heard the running and we stopped and looked
back and saw him coming up the path running, the level shadows flicking upon his legs.
"He’s in a hurry. We’d—” then I saw another man, an
oldish man running heavily, clutching a stick, and a boy
naked from the waist up, clutching his pants as he ran. "There’s Jxilio,” the little girl said, and then I saw his
158 THE SOUHD AND THE EXJBY
Italian face and his eyes as he sprang upon me. We went
down. His hands were jabbing at my face and he was
saying something and trying to bite me, I reckon, and
then they hauled him ofiE and held him heaving and
thrashing and yelling and they held his arms and he tried to kick me until they dragged him back. The little girl was howling, holding the loaf in both arms. The half- naked boy was darting and jumping up and down, clutch- ing his trousers and someone pulled me up in time to see another stark naked figure come around the tranquil
bend in the path mnning and change direction in midstride
and leap into the woods, a couple of garments
rigid as boards behind it. Julio still struggled. The man
who had pulled me up said, "Whoa, now. We got you.”
He wore a vest but no coat. Upon it was a metal shield. In his other hand he clutched a knotted, pohshed stick. "You re Anse, aren't you?” I said. "I was looking for you.
What's the matter?”
"I warn you that anything you say will be used against
you. he said. "You're under arrest.”
"I kiiia heem,” Julio said. He struggled. Two men held
him. The little girl howled steadily, holding the bread,
'Tou steala my seester,” Julio said. "Let go, meesters.”
"Steal his sister?” I said. "Why, I've been
—
"Shet up,” Anse said. ‘TTou can tell that to Squire.”
"Steal his sister?” I said. Julio broke from the men and
sprang at me again, but the marshall met him and they
struggled until the other two pinioned his arms again.
Anse released him, panting.
"You durn furriner,” he said, "I've got a good mind to take you up too, for assault and battery.” He turned to me
again. ‘Will you come peaceable, or do I handcuff you?”
"I'll come peaceable,” I said. "Anything, just so i can

jBbad someone—do something with—Stole his sister/’ I said. “Stole his—
”
“I’ve warned you/’ Anse said, “He aims to charge you
with meditated criminal assault. Here, you, make that gal shut up that noise.” “Oh,” I said. Then I began to laugh. Two more boys
with plastered heads and round eyes came out of the
bushes, buttoning shirts that had already dampened onto
their shoulders and arms, and I tried to stop the laughter,
but I couldnt. "Watch him, Anse, he’s crazy, I believe.”
"I’ll h-have to qu-quit,” I said, ""It’ll stop in a mu-minute.
The other time it said ah ah ah,” I said, laughing.
""Let me sit down a while.” I sat down, they watching me,
and the little girl with her streaked face and the gnawed
looking loaf, and the water swift and peaceful below the
path. After a while the laughter ran out. But my throat wouldnt quit trying to laugh, like retching after your
stomach is empty.
""Whoa, now,” Anse said. “Get a grip on yourself.”
""Yes,” I said, tightening my throat. There was another
yellow butterfly, like one of the sunflecks had come loose. After a while I didnt have to hold my throat so tight. I got up. ""I’m ready. Which way?”
We followed the path, the two others watching Juho
and the little girl and the boys somewhere in the rear. The path went along the river to the bridge. We crossed
it and the tracks, people coming to tlie doors co look at us and more boys materializing from somewhere imdl
when we turned into the main street we had quite a procession.
Before the drugstore stood an auto, a big one, but I didn’t recognise them until Mrs Bland said,
""Why, Quentin! Quentin Compsonl” Then I saw Ger-
l6o THE SOUND AND THE FUKY
aid, and Spoade in the back seat, sitting on the back of
his neck. And Shreve. I didnt know the two girls.
'‘Quentin Compson!'' Mrs Bland said. "Good afternoon," I said, raising my hat. Tm under
an*est. Tm sorry I didnt get your note. Did Shreve tell you?”
"Under arrest?” Shreve said. "Excuse me,” he said. He
heaved himself up and climbed over their feet and got
out. He had on a pair of my flannel pants, hke a glove. I didnt remember forgetting them. I didnt remember how
many chins Mrs Bland had, either. The prettiest girl was
with Gerald in front, too. They watched me through
veils, with a kind of delicate horror. "Who's under arrest?” Shreve said. "What s this, mister?”
"Gerald,” Mrs Bland said, "Send these people away.
You get in this car, Quentin.”
Gerald got out. Spoade hadnt moved.
"What s he done, Cap?” he said. “Robbed a hen house?”
"I warn you,” Anse said. "Do you know the prisoner?”
"Know him,” Shreve said. "Look here
—
"Then you can come along to the squire's. Youre obstinicting
justice. Come along.” He shook my arm.
"Well, good afternoon,” I said. "Im glad to have seen you all. Sorry I couldnt be with you.”
"You, Gerald,” Mrs Bland said. "Look here, constable,” Gerald said. "I warn you you're interfering with an oflBcer of the
law,” Anse said. "If you've anything to say, you can come
to the squire's and make cognizance of the prisoner.” We
went on. Quite a procession now, Anse and I leading. I could hear them telling them what it was, and Spoade
asking questions, and then Julio said something violently in Italian and I looked back and saw the little girl stand-
THE SOUKD AND THE FURY l6l
ing at the curb looking at me with her friendly, inscrut- able regard.
'"Git on home,” Julio shouted at her, '1 beat hell outa you.”
We went down the street and turned into a bit of lawn
in which, set back from the street, stood a one storey
building of brick trimmed with white. We went up the
rock path to the door, where Anse halted everyone
ex</interval><interval value=22 novelty=0.8453 residual=0.0112 level=normal>cept us and made them remain outside. We entered a bare room smelling of stale tobacco. There was a sheet
iron stove in tlie center of a wooden frame filled with
sand, and a faded map on the wall and the dingy plat of a township. Behind a scarred littered table a man with a fierce roach of iron grey hair peered at us over steel spectacles.
‘'Got him, did ye, Anse?” he said. “Got him. Squire.”
He opened a huge dusty book and drew it to him and
dipped a foul pen into an inkwell filled with what looked
like coal dust. “Look here, mister,” Shreve said. “The prisoner s name,” the squire said. I told him. He
wrote it slowly into the book, the pen scratching with ex- cruciating deliberation. “Look here, mister,” Shreve said, “We know this fellow
We—”
“Order in the court,” Anse said. “Shut up, bud,” Spoade said. “Let him do it his way
He’s going to anyhow.”
“Age,” the squire said. I told him. He wrote that, his mouth moving as he wrote. “Occupation.” I told him.
“Harvard student, hey?” he said. He looked up at me,
bowing his neck a little to see over the spectacles. His
x 62 the sound and the fuky
eyes were clear and cold, like a goats. 'What are you
up to, coming out here kidnapping children?”
"They re crazy, Squire ” Shreve said. "Whoever says
this boys kidnapping
—
Juho moved violently. "Crazy?” he said. "Dont I catcha
heem, eh? Dont I see weetha my own eyes—
”
"You re a liar,” Shreve said. "You never—
”
"Order, order,” Anse said, raising his voice. "You fellers shet up,” the squire said. "If they dont stay
quiet, turn ’em out, Anse.” They got quiet. The squire
looked at Shreve, then at Spoade, then at Gerald. "You
know this young man?” he said to Spoade.
"Yes, your honour,” Spoade said. "He’s just a country
boy in school up there. He dont mean any harm. I think
the marshall’ll find it’s a mistake. His father’s a congregational
minister.” "H’m,” the squire said. "What was you doing, exactly?”
I told him, he watching me with his cold, pale eyes. "How
about it, Anse?”
"Might have been,” Anse said. "Them durn furriners.”
"I American,” Julio said. "I gotta da pape’.”
"Where’s tlie gal?”
"He sent her home,” Anse said. "Was she scared or anything?”
"Not till Julio there jumped on the prisoner. They were
just walking along the river path, towards town. Some
boys swimming told us which way they went.”
"It’s a mistake, Squire,” Spoade said. "Children and
dogs are always taking up with him like that. He cant
help it.” "H’m,” the squire said. He looked out of the window
for a while. We watched him. I could hear Julio scratch- ing himself. The squire looked back.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 163
''Air you satisfied the gal aint took any hurt, you,
there?”
"No hurt now,” Julio said sullenly.
"You quit work to hunt for her?”
"Sure I quit. I run. I run like hell. Looka here, looka
there, then man tella me he seen him giva her she eat. She go weetha.”
"H m,” the squire said. "Well, son, I calculate you owe
Julio something for taking him away from his work.”
"Yes, sir,” I said. "How much?”
"Dollar, I calculate.”
I gave Julio a dollar. "Well,” Spoade said, "If thafs all—I reckon he’s dis- charged, your honour?”
The squire didn’t look at him. "How far’d you run him,
Anse?”
"Two miles, at least. It was about two hom's before we
caught him.”
"H’m,” the squire said. He mused a while. We watched
him, his stiff crest, the spectacles riding low on his nose. The 'yellow shape of the window grew slowly across the
floor, reached the wall, climbing. Dust motes whirled and
slanted. "Six dollars.” "Six dollars?” Shreve said. "What’s that for?”
"Six dollars,” the squire said. He looked at Shreve a moment, then at me again.
"Look here,” Shreve said. "Shut up,” Spoade said. "Give it to him, bud, and let’s get out of here. The ladies are waiting for us. You got
six dollars?” "Yes,” I said. I gave him six dollars. "Case dismissed,” he said. "You get a receipt,” Shreve said. "You get a signed re- ceipt for that money.”
i64 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
The squire looked at Shreve mildly. 'Case dismissed,
he said without raising his voice.
'Til be damned—” Shreve said. "Come on here/' Spoade said, taking his arm. "Good
afternoon, Judge. Much obliged." As we passed out the
door Julio's voice rose again, violent, then ceased. Spoade
was looking at me, his brown eyes quizzical, a little cold. "Well, bud, I reckon youll do your girl chasing in Boston after this." "You damned fool,” Shreve said, "What the hell do you mean anyway, straggling off here, fooling with these
damn wops?”
"Come on,” Spoade said, "They must be getting impatient.”
Mrs Bland was talking to them. They were Miss
Holmes and Miss Daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that delicate and curi- ous horror, their veils turned back upon their little white
noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the
veils. "Quentin Compson,” Mrs Bland said, "What would your
mother say? A young man naturally gets into scrapes, but to be arrested on foot by a country policeman. What
did they think he'd done, Gerald?”
"Nothing,” Gerald said. "Nonsense. What was it, you, Spoade?”
"He was trying to kidnap that little dirty girl, but they
caught him in time,” Spoade said. "Nonsense,” Mrs Bland said, but her voice sort of died
away and she stared at me for a moment, and the girls
drew their breaths in with a soft concerted sound. "Fiddlesticks,”
Mrs Bland said briskly, "If that isn't just like these ignorant lowclass Yankees. Get in, Quentin.”
THE SOUND AND THE FURY x6f
Shreve and I sat on two small collapsible seats. Gerald
cranked the car and got in and we started. "Now, Quentin, you tell me what all this foolishness
is about,” Mrs Bland said. I told them, Shreve hunched
and furious on his little seat and Spoade sitting again on the back of his neck beside Miss Daingerfield.
"And the joke is, all the time Quentin had us all fooled,”
Spoade said. "All the time we thought he was tlie model
youth that anybody could trust a daughter with, until the police showed him up at his nefarious work.”
"Hush up, Spoade,” Mrs Bland said. We drove down
the street and crossed the bridge and passed the house
where the pink garment hung in the window. "That's what you get for not reading my note. Why didnt you come and get it? Mr MacKenzie says he told you it was
there.” "Yessum. I intended to, but I never went back to the
room.”
"You'd have let us sit there waiting I dont know how
long, if it hadnt been for Mr MacKenzie. When he said
you hadnt come back, that left an extra place, so we
asked him to come. We're very glad to have you anyway,
Mr MacKenzie.” Shreve said nothing. His arms were
folded and he glared straight ahead past Gerald's cap. It was a cap for motoring in England. Mrs Bland said so. We passed that house, and three others, and another yard
where the little girl stood by the gate. She didnt have the
bread now, and her face looked like it had been streaked
with coaldust. I waved my hand, but she made no reply,
only her head turned slowly as tlie car passed, following us with her unwinking gaze. Then we ran beside the
wall, our shadows running along the wall, and after a while we passed a piece of torn newspaper lying beside

the road and I began to laugh again. I could feel it in my
throat and I looked off into the trees where the afternoon
slanted, thinking of afternoon and of the bird and the
boys in swimming. But still I couldnt stop it and then I knew that if I tried too hard to stop it Td be crying and
I thought about how I’d thought about I could not be a
virgin, witli so many of them walking along in the shad- ows and whispering with their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming out and per- fume and eyes you could feel not see, but if it was that
simple to do it wouldnt be anything and if it wasnt anything,
what was I and then Mrs Bland said, ''Quentin? Is he sick, Mr MacKenzie?” and then Shreve’s fat hand ^ touched my knee and Spoade began talking and I quit
trying to stop it. "If that hamper is in his way, Mr MacKenzie, move it over on your side. I brought a hamper of wine because
I think young gentlemen should drink wine, although my
father, Gerald’s grandfather” ever do that Have you ever done that In the grey darkness a little light her hands
locked about
"They do, when they can get it,” Spoade said. "Hey,
Shreve?” her knees her face looking at the sky the smell
of honeysuckle upon her face and throat
"Beer, too,” Shreve said. His hand touched my knee
again. I moved my knee again, like a thin wash of lilac coloured paint talking about him bringing
"You’re not a gentleman,” Spoade said, him between us
until the shape of her blurred not with dark
"No. I’m Canadian,” Shreve said, talking about him the
oar blades winking him along winking the Cap made for motoring in England and all time rushing beneath and
they two blurred within the other forever more he had
been in the army h/id killed men

“I adore Canada/’ Miss Daingerfield said. "I think it’s marvellous.”
''Did you ever drink perfume?” Spoade said, with one hand he could lift her to his shoulder and run ivith her

"No/’ Shreve said, running the beast with two backs
and she blurred in the winking oars running the swine of Euboeleus running coupled within how many Caddy

When they touched me 1 died one minute she was standing there the next he was yelling
and pulling at her dress they went into the hall and
up the stairs yelling and shoving at her up the stairs to the bathroom door and stopped her back against the door
and her arm across her face yelling and trying to shove
her into the bathroom when she came in to supper T. P. was feeding him he started again just whimpering at
first until she touched him then he yelled she stood there
her eyes like cornered rats then I was running in the grey
darkness it smelled of rain and all flower scents the damp
warm air released and crickets sawing away in the grass pacing me with a small travelling island of silence Fancy
watched me across the fence blotchy like a quilt on a
line I thought damn that nigger he forgot to feed her
again I ran down the hill in that vacuum of crickets like a breath travelling across a mirror she was lying in the water her head on the sand spit the water flowing about
her hips there was a little more light in the water hei
skirt half saturated flopped along her flanks to the waters motion in heavy ripples going nowhere renewed themselves
of their own movement I stood on the bank I could
smell the honeysuckle on the water gap the air seemed to drizzle with honeysuckle and with the rasping of crickets
a substance you could feel on the flesh
is Benjy still crying
I dont know yes I dont know
poor Benjy
I sat down on the bank the grass was damp a little then I found my shoes wet

out of the blur of the sand by her hair
get out now
she sat up then she rose her skirt flopped against her
draining she climbed the bank her clothes flopping sat down
why dont you wring it out do you want to catch cold
yes
the water sucked and gurgled across the sand spit and
on in the dark among the willows across the shallow the
water rippled like a piece of cloth holding still a little light as water does
he^s crossed all the oceans all around the world
then she talked about him clasping her wet knees her
face tilted back in the grey light the smell of honeysuckle
there was a light in mothers room and in Benjys where
T. P. was putting him to bed
do you love him
her hand came out I didnt move it fumbled down my
arm and she held my hand flat against her chest her heart
thudding no no

I/O THE SOUND AND THE FUKY
poor Quentin
her face looked at the sky it was low so low that all smells and sounds of night seemed to have been crowded
down like under a slack tent especially the honeysuckle it had got into my breathing it was on her face and throat
like paint her blood pounded against my hand I was lean- ing on my other arm it began to jerk and jump and I had
to pant to get any air at all out of that thick grey honeysuckle
yes I hate him I would die for him iVe already died
for him I die for him over and over again everytime this goes
when I lifted my hand I could still feel crisscrossed
t’vigs and grass burning into the palm

clock and the glare of to^vn the square on the sky and
the dark willows along the branch and the light in mothers windows the light still on in Benjys room and I stooped through the fence and went across the pasture
running I ran in the grey grass among the crickets the
honeysuckle getting stronger and stronger and the smell

17^ THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
looked over his shoulder then he turned his back he didnt
look up until I came onto the bridge and stopped he had
a piece of bark in his hands breaking pieces from it and
dropping them over the rail into the water
I came to tell you to leave town
he broke a piece of bark deliberately dropped it carefully
into the water watched it float away
I said you must leave town
he looked at me

I say you must go not my father not anybody 1 say it listen save this for a while I want to know if shes all right have they been bothering her up there
thats something you dont need to trouble yourself
ibout
then I heard myself saying 111 give you until sundown
to leave town
he broke a piece of bark and dropped it into the water
then he laid the bark on the rail and rolled a cigarette
with those two swift motions spun the match over the
railwhat will you do if I dont leave
111 kill you dont think that just because I look like a
kid to you
the smoke flowed in two jets from his nostrils across his facehow old are you

I hit him my open hand beat the impulse to shut it tu his face his hand moved as fast as mine the cigarette went
over the rail I swung with the other hand he caught it too before the cigarette reached the water he held both my
wrists in the same hand his other hand flicked to his armpit
under his coat behind him the sun slanted and a bird
singing somewhere beyond the sun we looked at one an- other while the bird singing he turned my hands loose look here
he took the bark from the rail and dropped it into the
water it bobbed up the current took it floated away his hand lay on the rail holding the pistol loosely we waited
you cant hit it now
no
it floated on it was quite still in the woods I heard the
bird again and the water afterward the pistol came up he
didnt aim at all the bark disappeared then pieces of it floated up spreading he hit two more of them pieces of bark no bigger than silver dollars thats enough I guess
he swung the cylinder out and blew into the barrel a thin wisp of smoke dissolved he reloaded the three
chambers shut the cylinder he handed it to me butt first what for I wont try to beat that
l8o THE SOUND AND THE EUEY
youll need it from what you said Im giving you this one because youve seen what itll do

I hit him I was still trying to hit him long after he was
holding my wrists but I still tried then it was like I was
looking at him through a piece of coloured glass I could
hear my blood and then I could see the sky again and
branches against it and the sun slanting through them
and he holding me on my feet did you hit me
I couldnt hear

I leaned on the rail looking at the water I heard him
untie the horse and ride oflF and after a while I couldnt
hear anything but the water and then the bird again I
left the bridge and sat down with my back against a tree and leaned my head against the tree and shut my eyes a patch of sun came through and feU across my eyes and I moved a little further around the tree I heard the bird
again and the water and then everything sort of rolled away and I didnt feel anything at all I felt almost good
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY l8l
after all those days and the nights with honeysuckle coming
up out of the darkness into my room where I was
trying to sleep even when after a while I knew that he
hadnt hit me that he had lied about that for her sake too and that I had just passed out like a girl but even that
didnt matter anymore and I sat there against the tree with little flecks of sunhght brushing across my face like yellow leaves on a twig listening to the water and not
thinking about anything at all even when I heard the
horse coming fast I sat there with my eyes closed and
heard its feet bunch scuttering the hissing sand and feet running and her hard running hands
fool fool are you hurt
I opened my eyes her hands running on my face
I didnt know which way until I heard the pistol I didnt
know where I didnt think he and you running off shpping

eyes and they looked like the eyes in the statues blank
and unseeing and serene put your hand against my throat she took my hand and held it flat against her throat

Dalton Ames
I felt the first surge of blood there it surged in strong
accelerating beats say it again
her face looked ofl into the trees where the sun slanted
and where the bird
say it again
Dalton Ames
her blood surged steadily beating and beating against
my hand
It kept on running for a long time, but my face felt cold and sort of dead, and my eye, and the cut place on my finger was smarting again. I could hear Shreve working
the pump, then he came back with the basin and a round blob of twilight wobbling in it, with a yellow edge
like a fading baUoon, then my reflection. I tiled to see my face in it. ''Has it stopped?” Shreve said. "Give me t</interval><interval value=25 novelty=0.8364 residual=0.005 level=normal>he rag.” He
tried to take it from my hand.
"Look out,” I said, "I can do it. Yes, iPs about stopped
now.” I dipped the rag again, breaking the balloon. The
rag stained the water. "I wish I had a clean one.”
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 183
‘Tou need a piece of beefsteak for that eye/’ Shreve
said. ''Damn if you wont have a shiner tomorrow. The
son of a bitch/’ he said. “Did I hurt him any?’' I wrung out the handkerchief
and tried to clean the blood off of my vest. “You cant get that off/’ Shreve said. ''You’ll have to send it to the cleaner’s. Come on, hold it on your eye, why dont you.”
“I can get some of it off/’ I said. But I wasn’t doing
much good. “What sort of shape is my collar in?”
“I dont know/’ Shreve said. “Hold it against youi* eye. Here.”
“Look out/’ I said. “I can do it. Did I hurt him any?”
“You may have hit him. I may have looked away just
then or blinked or something. He boxed the hell out of you. He boxed you all over the place. What did you want
to fight him with your fists for? You goddamn fool. Hov"
do you feel?”
“I feel fine” I said. “I wonder if I can get something
to clean my vest.” “Oh, forget your damn clothes. Does your eye hurt?”
“I feel fine,” I said. Everything was sort of violet and
still, the sky green paling into gold beyond the gable of the house and a plume of smoke rising from the chimney
without any wind. I heard the pump again. A man was
filling a pail, watching us across his pumping shoulder. A
woman crossed the door, but she didnt look out. I could
hear a cow lowing somewhere.
“Come on,” Shreve said, 'Tet your clothes alone and
put that rag on your eye. I’ll send your suit out first thing
tomorrow.”
“All right. I’m sorry I didn’t bleed on him a little, at
least.” “Son of a bitch/’ Shreve said. Spoade came out of ihf

house, talking to the woman I reckon, and crossed the
yard. He looked at me with his cold, quizzical eyes. "Well, bud,'' he said, looking at me, "111 be damned if you dont go to a lot of trouble to have your fun. Kidnapping,
then fighting. What do you do on your holi- days? burn houses?"
"1 m all right," I said. "What did Mrs Bland say?"
""She's giving Gerald hell for bloodying you up. Shell
give you hell for letting him, when she sees you. She dont
object to the fighting, its the blood that annoys her. I think you lost caste with her a little by not holding your
blood better. How do you feel?"
""Sure," Shreve said, "If you cant be a Bland, the next
best thing is to commit adultery with one or get drunk
and fight him, as the case may be."
""Quite right," Spoade said. ""But I didnt know Quentin was drunk."
"‘He wasnt,” Shreve said. ""Do you have to be drunk to want to hit that son of a bitch?"
""Well, I think Td have to be pretty drunk to try it, after seeing how Quentin came out. Where'd he learn to box?"
""He's been going to Mike's every day, over in town,"
I said. ^He has?" Spoade said. ""Did you know that when you
hit him?"
""I dont know," I said. ""I guess so. Yes." "Wet it again," Shreve said. ""Want some fresh water?"
""This is all right," I said. I dipped the cloth again and
held it to my eye. "Wish I had something to clean my
vest." Spoade was still watching me.
"Say," he said, ""What did you hit him for? What was
it he said?"
""I do^^ Vr»mxr T dont know why I did."
THE SOUND AND THE FUBY 1S5
The first I knew was when you jumped up all of a sudden and said, ‘Did you ever have a sister? did you?’
and when he said No, you hit him. I noticed you kept on looking at him, but you didnt seem to be paying any
attention to what anybody was saying until you jumped
up and asked him if he had any sisters.” “Ah, he was blowing off as usual,” Shreve said, “about
his women. You know: like he does, before girls, so they
dont know exactly what he’s saying. All his damn innu- endo and lying and a lot of stuff that dont make sense
even. Telling us about some wench that he made a date
with to meet at a dance hall in Atlantic City and stood
her up and went to the hotel and went to bed and how
he lay there being sorry for her waiting on the pier for him, without him there to give her what she wanted.
Talking about the body’s beauty and the sorry ends
thereof and how tough women have it, without anything
else they can do except lie on their backs. Leda lurking
in the bushes, whimpering and moaning for the swan,
see. The son of a bitch. I’d hit him myself. Only I’d grabbed up her damn hamper of wine and done it if it had been me.”
“Oh,” Spoade said, “the champion of dames. Bud, you
excite not only admiration, but horror.” He looked at me,
cold and quizzical. “Good God,” he said. “I’m sorry I hit him,” I said. “Do I look too bad to go
back and get it over with?”
“Apologies, hell,” Shreve said, “Let them go to heU.
We’re going to town.”
“He ought to go back so they’ll know he fights like a gentleman,” Spoade said. “Gets licked like one, I mean.’^ “Like this?” Shreve said, “With his clothes all ov^
blood?”
“Why, all right,” Spoade said, “You know best

"‘He cant go around in his undershirt/’ Shreve said, "He’s not a senior yet. Come on, let’s go to town.’’ ""You neednt come/’ I said. ""You go on back to the pic-

""What’ll I tell them?” Spoade said. ""Tell them you and
Quentin had a fight too?”
""Tell them nothing,” Shreve said. ""Tell her her option
expired at sunset. Come on, Quentin. I’ll ask that woman
where the nearest interurban

""No,” I said, ""I’m not going back to town.”
Shreve stopped, looking at me. Turning, his glasses
looked like small yellow moons.
""What are you going to do?”
""I’m not going back to town yet. You go on back to the picnic. Tell them I wouldnt come back because my
clothes were spoiled.” ""Look here,” he said, ""What are you up to?”
""Nothing. I’m all right. You and Spoade go on back,
m see you tomorrow.” I went on across the yard, to- ward the road.
""Do you know where the station is?” Shreve said.
""I’ll find it. I’ll see you all tomorrow. Tell Mrs Bland
I’m sorry I spoiled her party.” They stood watching me.
I went around the house. A rock path went down to the
mad. Roses grew on both sides of the path. I went
through the gate, onto the road. It dropped dovmhill, to- ward the woods, and I could make out the auto beside
the road. I went up the hiU. The light increased as I mounted, and before I reached the top I heard a car. It isounded far away across the twfiight and I stopped and
listened to it. I couldnt make out the auto any longer,
but Shreve was standing in the road before the house,
looking up the hill. Behind him the yellow light lay like

a wash of paint on the roof of the house. I lifted my
hand and went on over the hill, listening to the car. Then
the house was gone and I stopped in the green and yellow
light and heard the car growing louder and louder,
until just as it began to die away it ceased all together. I waited until I heard it start again. Then I went on. As I descended the light dwindled slowly, yet at the same time without altering its quality, as if I and not
light were changing, decreasing, though even when the road ran into trees you could have read a newspaper.
Pretty soon I came to a lane. I turned into it. It was
< loser and darker than the road, but when it came out af he trolley stop—another wooden marquee—^the light
^as still unchanged. After the lane it seemed brighter, as iihough I had walked through night in the lane and come
out into morning again. Pretty soon the car came. I got on it, they turning to look at my eye, and found a seat on
the left side. The lights were on in the car, so while we ran between
trees I couldnt see anything except my own face and a woman across the aisle with a hat sitting right on top of her head, with a broken feather in it, but when we ran
out of the trees I could see the twilight again, that quality
of light as if time really had stopped for a while, with
the sun hanging just under the horizon, and then we
passed the marquee where the old man had been eating out of the sack, and the road going on under the twihght,
into twihght and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond. Then the car went on, the draught building
steadily up in the open door until it was drawing steadily
through the car witib the odour of summer and darkness
except honeysuckle. Honeysuckle was the saddest odour
of all, I think. I remember lots of them. Wistaria was one> On the rainy days when Mother wasnt feehng quite bad

enougli to stay away from the windows we used to play
under it. When Mother stayed in bed Dilsey would put
old clothes on us and let us go out in the rain because
she said rain never hmt young folks. But if Motlier was up we always began by playing on the porch until she
said we were making too much noise, then we went out and played under the wistaria frame.
This was where I saw the river for the last time this morning, about here. I could feel water beyond the twilight,
smell. When it bloomed in the spring and it rained
the smell was everywhere you didnt notice it so much at other times but when it rained the smell began to come
into the house at twilight either it would rain more at twilight or there was something in the light itself but it always smelled strongest then until I would lie in bed
tfainldng when will it stop when will it stop. The draft
in the door smelled of water, a damp steady breath. Sometimes I could put myself to sleep saying that over and over until after the honeysuckle got all mixed up in
it the whole thing came to symbolise night and unrest
I seemed to be lying neither asleep nor awake looking
dovm a long corridor of grey halflight where all stable
things had become shadowy paradoxical all I had done
shadows all I had felt suffered taking visible foim antic and perverse mocking without relevance inherent themselves
with the denial of the significance they should have
affirmed thinking I was I was not who </interval><interval value=26 novelty=0.8408 residual=0.0103 level=normal>was not was not
who.
I could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk
and I saw the last light supine and tranquil upon tideflats
like pieces of broken mirror, then beyond them
lights began in the pale clear air, trembling a little like
butterflies hovering a long way off. Benjamin the child

failing in which conflict tempered silenced reconciled. Benjamin the child of mine old age held hostage into Egypt. O Benjamin. Dilsey said it was because Mother was too proud for him. They come into white people’s
lives like that in sudden sharp black trickles that isolate white facts for an instant in unarguable truth like under
a microscope; the rest of the time just voices that laugh
when you see nothing to laugh at, tears when no reason
for tears. They will bet on the odd or even number of mourners at a funeral. A brothel full of them in Memphis
went into a religious trance ran naked into the street. It took three policemen to subdue one of them. Yes Jesus 0 good man Jesus O that good man. The car stopped. I got out, with them looking at my
eye. When the trolley came it was full. I stopped on the back platform.
^'Seats up front,” the conductor said. I looked into the
car. There were no seats on the left side. 'Tm not going far,” I said. "Til just stand here.” We crossed the river. The bridge, that is, arching slov> and high into space, between silence and nothingness
where lights—^yellow and red and green—^trembled in the clear air, repeating themselves.
“Better go up front and get a seat,” the conductor said. “I get off pretty soon,” I said. “A couple of blocks.” I got off before we reached the postoflSce. They’d all be sitting around somewhere by now though, and then
1 was hearing my watch and I began to listen for the
chimes and I touched Shreve’s letter through my coat,
the bitten shadows of the elms flowing upon my hand.
And then as I turned into the quad the chimes did begin
and I went on while the notes came up like ripples on a pool and passed me and went on, saying Quarter to what? All right. Quarter to what.
190 THE OOTJlSrD AND THE FTJBY
Our windows were dark. The entrance was empty. I walked close to the left wall when I entered, but it was
empty: just the stairs curving up into shadows echoes of
feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the shad^
ows, my feet waking them like dust, lightly to settle again.
I could see the letter before I turned the light on, propped against a book on the table so I would see it. Calling him my husband. And then Spoade said they were going somewhere, would not be back until late, and Mrs Bland would need another cavalier. But I would
have seen him and he cannot get another car for an hour
because after six oclock. I took out my watch and lis- tened to it chcking away, not knowing it couldnt even
lie. Then I laid it face up on the table and took Mrs
Bland’s letter and tore it acioss and dropped the pieces
into the waste basket and took ojff my coat, vest, collar,
tie and shirt. The tie was spoiled too, but then niggers.
Maybe a pattern of blood he could call that the one
Christ was wearing. I found the gasoline in Shreve’s room
and spread the vest on the table, where it would be flat, and opened the gasoline.

had a mother so I could say Mother Mother It took a lot of gasoline, and then I couldnt tell if it was still the stain or just the gasoline. It had started the cut to smarting
again so when I went to wash I hung the vest on a chair
and lowered the light cord so that the bulb would be
drying the splotch. I washed my face and hands, but
even then I could smell it within the soap stinging, constricting
the nostrils a little. Then I opened the bag and
THE SOmSTD AND THE rUEY 19/
took the shirt and collar and tie out and put the bloody
ones in and closed the bag, and dressed. While I was
brushing my hair the half hour went. But there was until the three quarters anyway, except suppose seeing on the

I turned out the light and went into my bedroom, out
of the gasoline but I could still smell it. I stood at the
window tire curtains moved slow out of the darkness
touching my face like someone breathing asleep, breath- ing slow into the darkness again, leaving the touch. After
they had gone up stairs Mother lay hack in her chair, the camphor handkerchief to her mouth. Father hadnt
moved he still sat beside her holding her hand the bel

building and building up until I would have to pant to get any air at all out of it until I would have to get up
and feel my way like when I was a little boy hands can
see touching in the mind shaping unseen door Door now
nothing hands can see My nose could see gasoline, the
vest on the table, the door. The corridor was still empty
of all the feet in sad generations seeking water, yet the

just one of those town squirts that Father was always
teasing her about until, I didnt notice him any more than
any other stranger drummer or what thought they were army shirts until all of a sudden I knew he wasn’t thinking

waiting for him to get done looking at it and come down
Grandfather wore his uniform and we could hear the murmur of their voices from beyond the cedars they were

there trying not to think of the swing until all cedars came to have that vivid dead smell of perfume that Benjy hated so. Just by imagining the clump it seemed to me that I could hear whispers secret surges smell the
beating of hot blood under wild unsecret flesh watching
against red eyelids the swine untethered in pairs rushing
coupled into the sea and he we must just stay awake

petty chicanery that would not deceive a child until someday in very disgust he risks everything on a single

to think that a love or a sorrow is a bond purchased with- out design and which matures willynilly and is recalled without warning to be replaced by whate^^er issue the

the darkness was still again. I entered the sitting room
and turned on the light. I put my vest on. The gasoline was faint now, barely noticeable, and in the mirror the
stain didnt show. Not like my eye did, anyway. I put on my coat. Shreve’s letter crackled thi'ough the cloth and I took it out and examined the address, and put it in my
side pocket. Then I carried the watch into Shreve's room
and put it in his drawer and went to my room and got a fresh handkerchief and went to the door and put my
hand on the light switch. Then I remembered I hadnl
brushed my teeth, so I had to open the bag again. I found my toothbrush and got some of Shreve’s paste and
went out and brushed my teeth. I squeezed the brush as dry as I could and put it back in the bag and shut it, and went to the door again. Before I snapped the
light out I looked around to see if there was anything
else, then I saw that I had forgotten my hat. Td have to go by the postoffice and I'd be sure to meet some of them,
and they'd think I was a Harvard Square student making
like he was a senior. I had forgotten to brush it too, but
Shreve had a brush, so I didnt have to open the bag any
more.

O
NCE A BITCH ALWAYS A BITCH, WHAT I SAY. I SAYS
you re lucky if her playing out of school is all that
worries you. I says she ought to be down there in that kitchen right now, instead of up there in her room, gobbing
paint on her face and waiting for six niggers that cant even stand up out of a chair unless they ve got a pan full of bread and meat to balance them, to fix breakfast
for her. And Mother says, "But to have the school authorities think that I have
no control over her, that I cant
—
"Well,” I says, ""You cant, can you? You never have
tried to do anything with her,” I says, ""How do you ex- pect to begin this late, when she’s seventeen years old?”
She thought about that for a while.
""But to have them think that ... I didn’t even know
she had a report card. She told me last fall that they had
quit using them this year. And now for Professor Junkin
to call me on the telephone and tell me if she’s absent one more time, she will have to leave school. How does
she do it? Where does she go? You’re down town all day;
you ought to see her if she stays on the streets.” 198

''Yes/’ I says, "If she stayed on the streets. I dont reckon
* she’d be playing out of school just to do something she
could do in public/’ I says. "What do you mean?” she says. "I dont mean anything/’ I says. "I just answered your
question.” Then she begun to cry again, talking about
how her own flesh and blood rose up to curse her
"You asked me,” I says.
"I dont mean you,” she says. "You are the only one of them that isn’t a reproach to me.”
"Sure,” I says, "I never had time to be. I never had
time to go to Harvard like Quentin or drink myself into the ground like Father. I had to work. But of course if you want me to follow her around and see what she does,
I can quit the store and get a job where I can work at night. Then I can watch her during the day and you can
use Ben for tlie night shift.” 1 know I’m just a trouble and a burden to you,” she
says, crying on the pillow.
"I ought to know it/’ I says. "You’ve been telling me
that for thirty years. Even Ben ought to Icnow it now. Do
you want me to say anything to her about it?” "Do you tliink it will do any good?” she says. "Not if you come down there interfering just when I get started,” I says. "If you want me to conti-ol her, just
say so and keep your hands off. Everytime I fay to, you come butting in and then she gives both of us the laugh.”
"Remember she’s your own flesh and blood,” she says. "Sure,” I says, "that’s just what I’m thinking of—flesh. And a little blood too, if I had my way. When people act
like niggers, no matter who they are the only thing to do is treat them like a nigger.” "I’m afraid you’ll lose your temper with her,” she says. "Well,” I says, "You haven’t had much luck with your

“Well,” I says, “I reckon he’s entitled to guess wrong now and then, like anybody else, even a Smith or a

“To hear you speak bitterly of your dead father,” she
says. “All right,” I says, “all right. Have it your way. But as
I haven’t got an office. I’ll have to get on to what I have
got. Do you want me to say anything to her?”
“I’m afraid you’ll lose your temper with her,” she says- “All right,” I says, “I wont say anything, then.” “But something must be done,” she says. “To have people

“Now, now,” I says, “You’U make yourself sick. Why
dont you either lock her up all day too, or turn her over

“My own flesh and blood,” she says, crying. So I says, “All right, m tend to her. Quit crying, now.”
“Dont lose your temper,” she says. “She’s just a ohUd,

“No,” I says, “I wont.” I went out, closing the door.
“Jason,” she says. I didn’t answer. I went down the
hall. “Jason,” she says beyond the door. I went on down
stairs. There wasn’t anybody in the diningroom, then I

heard her in the kitchen. She was trying to make Dilse)
let her have another cup of coffee. I went in. “1 reckon that’s your school costume, is it?” I says. "'Or maybe today’s a holiday?”
“Just a half a cup, Dilsey,” she says. “Please.” “No, suh,” Diisey says, “I aint gwine do it. You aint got no business wid mo’n one cup, a seventeen year old gal, let lone whut Miss Cahline say. You go on and git
dressed for school, so you kin ride to town wid Jason. You fixin to be late again.”
“No she’s not,” I says. 'We’re going to fix that right
now.” She looked at me, the cup in her hand. She
brushed her hair back from her face, her kimono slipping
off her shoulder. “You put that cup down and come in here a minute,” I says. “What for?” she says. “Come on,” I says. “Put that cup in the sink and come
in here.”
“What you up to now, Jason?” Diisey says. “You may think you can run over me like you do your
grandmother and everybody else,” I says, "But you’ll find out different. I’ll give you ten seconds to put that cup
down like I told you.”
She quit looking at me. She looked at Diisey. “What

I grabbed her by the arm. She dropped the cup. It broke on the floor and she jerked back, looking at me,
but I held her arm. Diisey got up from her chair. “You, Jason,” she says. “You turn me loose,” Quentin says, “I’ll slap you.”
'Tou will, will you?” I says, “You will will you?” She
slapped at me. I caught that hand too and held her like
102 THE SOXJHD AND THE FUEY
a wildcat. 'Tou will, will you?’^ I says. "You think you
will?'’ 'Y'ou, Jason!” Dilsey says. I dragged her into the diningroom.
Her kimono came unfastened, flapping about
her; damn near naked. Dilsey came hobbling along. I turned and kicked the door shut in her face. "You keep out of here,” I says. Quentin was leaning against the table, fastening her
kimono. I looked at her. "Now,” I says, "I want to know what you mean, playing
out of school and telling your grandmother lies and
forging her name on your report and worrying her sick. What do you mean by it.^” She didn’t say anything. She was fastening her kimono
up under her chin, pulling it tight around her, looking at me. She hadn’t got around to painting herself yet and
her face looked like she had polished it with a gun rag. I went and grabbed her wrist. "What do you mean?” I says. "None of your damn business/’ she says. "You turn me
loose.” Dilsey came in the door. 'Tou, Jason,” she says. "You get out of here, like I told you,” I says, not even
looking back. "I want to know where you go when you
play out of school,” I says. ‘Tou keep off the streets, or
I’d see you. Who do you play out with? Are you hiding
out in the woods with one of those damn slick-headed
jellybeans? Is that where you go?”
"TTou—^you old goddamn!” she says. She fought, but I held her. 'Y'ou damn old goddamn!” she says.
"I’ll show you,” I says. "You may can scare an old
woman off, but I’U show you who’s got hold of you now.”
I held her with one hand, then she quit fighting and
watched me, her eyes getting wide and black.

“What are you going to do?” she says. “You wait until I get this belt out and I’ll show you”
I says, pulling my belt out. Then Dilsey grabbed my arm.
Jason, she says, “You, Jason! Aint you shamed of yourself.”
“Dilsey,” Quentin says, “Dilsey.”
I aint gwine let him, Dilsey says, “Dont you worry,
honey. She held to my arm. Then the belt came out and I jerked loose and flung her away. She stumbled into the table. She was so old she couldn’t do any more than move hardly. But thats all right: we need somebody in the kitchen to eat up the grub the young ones cant tote
off. She came hobbhng between us, trying to hold me
again. “Hit me, den,” she says, “ef nothin else but hittin somebody wont do you. Hit me,” she says. “Yon think I wont?” I says.
“I dont put no devilment beyond you,” she says. Then
I heard Mother on the stairs. I might have known she
>vasn’t going to keep out of it. I let go. She stumbled
back against the wall, holding her kimono shut. “All right,” I says, “We’ll just put this off a while. But
dont think you can run it over me. I’m not an old woman,
nor an old half dead nigger, either. You damn httle slut,”
I says. Dilsey/’ she says, "Dilsey, I want my mother.”
Dilsey went to her. "Now, now,” she says, "He aint gwine so much as lay his hand on you while Ise here.” Mother came on down the stairs. "Jason,” she says, "Dilsey.”
Now, now,” Dilsey says, "I aint gwine let him tech
you.” She put her hand on Quentin. She knocked it down.
"You damn old nigger,” she says. She ran toward the
door.
204 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
"‘Dilsey ” Mother says on the stairs. Quentin ran up the
stairs, passing her. ‘"Quentin,” Mother says, “You, Quentin.”
Quentin ran on. I could hear her when she reached
the top, tlien in the hall. Then the door slammed.
Mother had stopped. Then she came on. “Dilsey,” she
says. “All right,” Dilsey says, 'Tse comin. You go on and git
dat car and wait now,” she says, “so you kin cahy her to
school.” “Dont you worry,” I says. “Ill take her to school and
Tm going to see that she stays there. Tve started this thing, and Tm going through with it.” “Jason,” Mother says on the stairs. “Go on, now,” Dilsey says, going toward the door. “You
want to git her started too? Ise comin. Miss Cahhne.”
I went on out. I could hear them on the steps. “You go on back to bed now,” Dilsey was saying, “Dont you
know you aint feeling well enough to git up yet? Go on
back, now. Tm gwine to see she gits to school in time.”
I went on out the back to back the car out, then I had to go all the way round to the front before I found
them.
“I thought I told you to put that tire on the back of the car,” I says.
“I aint had time,” Luster says. “Aint nobody to watch
him till mammy git done in de kitchen.”
“Yes,” I says, “I feed a whole damn kitchen full of nig- gers to follow around after him, but if I want an automobile
tire changed, I have to do it myself.”
“I aint had nobody to leave him wid,” he says. Then
he begun moaning and slobbering.
“Take him on round to the back,” I says. “What the
hell makes you want to keep him around here vijjiere people
can see him?” I made them go on, before he got
tut: sou::d and the euky
started bellowing good. It’s bad enough on Sundays, with
that damn field full of people that haven’t got a side show and six niggers to feed, knocking a damn oversize
mothball around. He’s going to keep on running up and
down that fence and bellowing every time they come in
sight until first thing I know they’re going to begin
charging me golf dues, then Mother and Dilsey’ll have tG get a couple of china door knobs and a walking stick and work it out, unless I play at night with a lantern. Then they’d send us all to Jackson, maybe. God knows,
they’d hold Old Home week when that happened.
I went on back to the garage. There was the tire, lean* ing against the wall, but be damned if I was going to put
it on. I backed out and turned around. She was standing
by the drive. I says,
“1 know you haven’t got any books: I just want to ask
you what you did with them, if it’s any of my business. Of course I haven’t got any right to ask,” I says, 'I’m jusf
the one tiiat paid $11.65 for them last September.”
"Mother buys my books,” she says. "There’s not a cent
of your money on me. I’d starve first.” "Yes?” I says. "You tell your grandmother that and see what she says. You dont look all the way naked,” I says, "even if that stuff on your face does hide more of you
than anything else you’ve got on.” "Do you think your money or hers either paid for a
cent of this?” she says. "Ask your grandmother,” I says. "Ask her what became
of those checks. You saw her burn one of them, as I re- member.” She wasn’t even listening, with her face all gummed up with paint and her eyes hard as a fice dog’s.
"Do you know what I’d do if I thought your money
or hers either bought one cent of this?” she says, putting
her hand on her dress.

‘What would you do?” I says, “Wear a barrel?’' “I’d tear it right off and throw it into the street,” she
says. “Dont you beheve me?”
“Sure you would,” I says. “You do it every time.”
“See if I wouldn’t,” She says. She grabbed the neck of her dress in both hands and made like she would tear it. “You tear that dress,” I says, “And I’ll give you a whipping
right here that you’ll remember all your life.” “See if I dont,” she says. Then I saw that she really was trying to tear it, to tear it right off of her. By the
ti</interval><interval value=29 novelty=0.8098 residual=-0.018 level=normal>me I got the car stopped and grabbed her hands there was about a dozen people looking. It made me so mad
for a minute it kind of blinded me. “You do a thing like that again and I’ll make you sorry you ever drew breath,” I says. “I’m sorry now,” she says. She quit, then her eyes
turned kind of funny and I says to myself if you cry here
in this car, on the street, I’ll whip you. I’ll wear you out. Lucky for her she didn’t, so I turned her wrists loose and
drove on. Luckily we were near an alley, where I could
turn into the back street and dodge the square. They
were already putting the tent up in Beard’s lot. Earl had
already given me the two passes for our show windows.
She sat there with her face turned away, chewing her
hp. ‘Tm sorry now,” she says. “I dont see why I was ever bom.”
“And I know of at least one other person that dont understand
all he knows about that,” I says, I stopped in front of the school house. The bell had rung, and the last of them were just going in. “You’re on time for once, anyway,”
I says. “Are you going in there and stay there, or am I coming with you and make you?” She got out and
banged the door. “Remember what I say,” I says, “I mean
it. Let me hear one more time that you are sHpping up
THE SOTJIS'D AKD THE FUBY 2o;- and down back alleys with one of those damn squirts/
She turned back at that. "I dont slip around/’ she says.
“I dare anybody to know everything I do.” ''And they all know it, too,” I says. "Everybody in this town knows what you are. But I wont have it anymore,
you hear? I dont care what you do, myself,” I says, "But
fve got a position in this town, and Fm not going to have any member of my family going on like a nigger
wench. You hear me?”
"I dont care,” she says, 'Tm bad and Ym going to hell,
and I dont care. I’d rather be in hell than anywhere
where you are.”
"If I hear one more time that you haven’t been to school, youll 'svish you were in hell,” I says. She turned
and ran on across the yard. "One more time, remember,”
I says. She didn’t look back.
I went to the postoffice and got the mail and drove on
to the store and parked. Earl looked at me when I came
in. I gave him a chance to say something about my being
late, but he just said,
"Those cultivators have come. You’d better help Uncle
Job put them up.”
I went on to the back, where old Job was uncrating
them, at the rate of about three bolts to the hour.
"You ought to be working for me,” I says. "Every other no-count nigger in town eats in my kitchen.”
"I works to suit de man whut pays me Sat’dy night,’'
he says. "When I does dat, it dont leave me a whole lot of time to please other folks.” He screwed up a nut. "Aint
nobody works much in dis country cep de boll-weevil,
noways,” he says. "You’d better be glad you’re not a boU-weevil waiting on those cultivators,” I says. "You’d work yourself to death before they’d be ready to prevent you.”
i 08 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
"Dafs de troof,” he says, "Boll-weevil got tough time.
Work evy day in de week out in de hot sun, rain er
shine. Aint got no front porch to set on en watch de wattermilyuns
growin and Sat'dy dont mean nothin a-tall to
him.’’ "Saturday wouldn’t mean nothing to you, either,”
i says, "if it depended on me to pay you wages. Get those
tilings out of the crates now and drag them inside.”
I opened her letter first and took the check out. Just
like a woman. Six days late. Yet they try to make men believe
that they’re capable of conducting a business. How long would a man that thought the first of the
month came on the sixth last in business. And like as
not, when they sent the bank statement out, she would
want to know why I never deposited my salary until the
sixth. Things like that never occur to a woman.
"I had no answer to my letter about Quentin’s easter
dress. Did it arrive all right? I’ve had no answer to the
last two letters I wrote her, though the check in the
second one was cashed with the other check. Is she
sick? Let me know at once or I’ll come there and see
for myself. You promised you would let me know
when she needed things. I will expect to hear from you
before the 10th. No you’d better wire me at once. You
are opening my letters to her. I know that as well as if I were looking at you. You’d better wire me at once
about her to this address.” About that time Earl started yelling at Job, so I put
them away and went over to try to put some life into him. What this country needs is white labour. Let these
damn trifling niggers starve for a couple of years, then
they’d see what a soft thing they have.
THE tyOTJNJD AXD TBte EXTH'T* 20^ Along toward ten oclock I went up front. There was a drummer there. It was a couple of minutes to ten, and I invited him up the street to get a coca-cola. We got to talking about crops.
''There's nothing to it," I says, "Cotton is a speculator s crop. They fill the farmer full of hot air and get him to
raise a big crop for them to whipsaw on the market, to trim the suckers with. Do you think the farmer gets anything
out of it except a red neck and a hump in his back?
You think the man that sweats to put it into the ground
gets a red cent more than a bare living," I says. "Let him
make a big crop and it wont be worth picking; let him
make a small crop and he wont have enough to gin. And
what for? so a bunch of damn eastern jews, Tm not talk- ing about men of the Jewish religion," I says, "IVe
known some jews that were fine citizens. You might be one yourself," I says. "No," he says, "I’m an American."
"No offense," I says. "I give every man his due, regardless
of religion or anything else. I have nothing against
jews as an individual,” I says. "It’s just the race. You’ll ad- mit that they produce nothing. They follow the pioneers
into a new country and sell them clothes." "You’re thinking of Armenians," he says, "aren’t you. A
pioneer wouldn’t have any use for new clothes." "No offense," I says. "I dont hold a man’s religion
against him."
"Sure," he says, "I’m an American. My folks have some
French blood, why I have a nose like this. Tm an American,
all right.”
"So am I," I says. "Not many of us left. What I’m talk- ing about is the fellows that sit up there in New York
and trim the sucker gamblers."
210 THE SOUND AND THE EUKY
"'That's right," he says. "Nothing to gambling, for a
poor man. There ought to be a law against it." "Dont you think I’m right?" I says. "Yes," he says, "I guess you're right. The farmer catches
it coming and going."
"I know I'm right," I says. "It's a sucker game, unless a man gets inside information from somebody that knows
what’s going on. I happen to be associated with some
people whore right there on the ground. They have one
of the biggest manipulators in New York for an adviser. Way I do it,” I says, "I never risk much at a time. It's the
fellow that thinks he knows it all and is trying to make a
killing with three dollars that they're laying for. That’s
why they are in the business." Then it struck ten. I went up to the telegraph office. It opened up a little, just like they said. I went into the
corner and took out the telegram again, just to be sure. While I was looldng at it a report came in. It was up two
points. They were all buying. I could tell that from what
they were saying. Getting aboard. Like they didn't know
it could go but one way. Like there was a law or something
against doing anything but buying. Well, I reckon
those eastern jews have got to live too. But I'll be
damned if it hasn’t come to a pretty pass when any damn
foreigner that cant make a living in the country where
God put him, can come to this one and take money
right out of an American's pockets. It was up two points more. Four points. But hell, they were right there and
hiew what was going on. And if I wasn't going to take
the advice, what was I paying them ten dollars a month
for. I went out, then I remembered and came back and
?ent the wire. "All well. Q writing today."
“Q?” the operator says.
""Yes," I says, "Q. Cant you spell Q?"
THB SOUND AND THE FUEY ZH
just asked to be sure,” he says. ‘'You send it like I wrote it and I’ll guarantee you to be
sure,” I says. “Send it collect” “What you sending, Jason?” Doc Wright says, looking over my shoulder. “Is that a code message to buy?”
“That’s all right about that,” I says. “You boys use your own judgment. You know more about it tlian those
New York folks do.” “Well, I ought to,” Doc says, “I’d a saved money this year raising it at two cents a pound.”
Another report came in. It was down a point. “Jason’s selling,” Hopkins says. “Look at his face.” “That’s all right about what I’m doing,” I says. “You
boys follow your own judgment. Those rich New York
jews have got to live lilce everybody else,” I says.
I went on back to the store. Earl was busy up front
I went on back to the desk and read Lorraine’s letter. “Dear daddy wish you were here. No good parties when
daddys out of town I miss my sweet daddy.” I reckon
she does. Last time I gave her forty dollars. Gave it to her. I never promise a woman anything nor let her know
what I’m going to give her. That’s the only way to manage
them. Always keep them guessing. If you cant think
of any other way to surprise them, give them a bust in the jaw.
I tore it up and bui*ned it over the spittoon. I make
it a rule never to keep a scrap of paper bearing a woman’s hand, and I never write them at all. Lorraine is always after me to write to her but I says anything I for- got to tell you will save till I get to Memphis again but
I says I dont mind you writing me now and then in a plain envelope, but if you ever try to call me up on the
telephone, Memphis wont hold you I says. I says when
I’m up there I’m one of the boys, but I’m not going to
2.12 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
have any woman calling me on the telephone. Here I
says, giving her the forty dollars. If you ever get drunk
and take a notion to call me on the phone, just remember
this and count ten before you do it. "‘Whenll that be?’' she says. 'What?” I says. 'When you’re</interval><interval value=30 novelty=0.8737 residual=0.0467 level=high> coming back,” she says. "ril let you know,” I says. Then she tried to buy a beer,
but I wouldn’t let her. "Keep your money,” I says. ‘'Buy
yourself a dress with it.” I gave the maid a five, too. After
all, like I say money has no value; it’s just the way you
spend it. It dont belong to anybody, so why try to hoard
it. It just belongs to the man that can get it and keep it. There’s a man right here in Jefferson made a lot of money
selling rotten goods to niggers, lived in a room over the
store about the size of a pigpen, and did his own cooking.
About four or five years ago he was taken sick. Scared the hell out of him so that when he was up again
he joined the church and bought himself a Chinese missionary,
five thousand dollars a year. I often think how
mad he’ll be if he was to die and find out there’s not any
heaven, when he thinks about that five thousand a year. Like I say, he’d better go on and die now and save money.
When it was burned good I was just about to shove
the others into my coat when all of a sudden something
told me to open Quentin’s before I went home, but about
that time Earl started yelling for me up front, so I put
them away and went and waited on the damn red- neck while he spent fifteen minutes deciding whether
he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a thirty-five cent
one.Wou d better take that good one,” I says. "How do you
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 21

fellows ever expect to get ahead, trying to work with
cheap equipment?”
“If this one aint any good,” he says, “why have you
got it on sale?”
“I didn t say it wasn't any good,” I says, “I said it's not
as good as that other one
” “How do you know it’s not,” he says. “You ever use airy one of them?”
“Because they dont ask thii'ty-five cents for it,” I says. “That’s how I know it’s not as good.”
He held the twenty cent one in his hands, drawing it through his fingers. “I reckon I’ll take this hyer one,” he
says. I offered to take it and wrap it, but he rolled it up
and put it in his overalls. Then he took out a tobacco
sack and finally got it untied and shook some coins out. He handed me a quarter. “That fifteen cents will buy me
a snack of dinner,” he says. “All right,” I says, “You’re the doctor. But dont come
complaining to me next year when you have to buy a new outfit.” “I aint makin next year’s crop yit,” he says. Finally I got rid of him, but every time I took that letter out something
would come up. They were all in town for the
show, coming in in droves to give their money to something
that brought nothing to the tovm and wouldn’t
leave anything except what those grafters in the Mayor’s
office will split among themselves, and Earl chasing back
and forth like a hen in a coop, saying ‘"Yes, ma’am, Mr
Compson will wait on you. Jason, show this lady a chum or a nickel’s worth of screen hooks.”
Well, Jason likes work. I says no I never had university
advantages because at Harvard they teach you how to go for a swim at night without knowing how to swim
214 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
and at Sewanee they dont even teach you what water is. I says you might send me to the state University; maybe
ril learn how to stop my clock with a nose spray and
then you can send Ben to the Navy I says or to the
cavalry anyway, they use geldings in the cavalry. Then
when she sent Quentin home for me to feed too I says I guess thafs right too, instead of me having to go way up
north for a job they sent the job down here to me and
then Mother begun to cry and I says it's not that I have
any objection to having it here; if its any satisfaction to you ril quit work and nurse it myself and let you and
Dilsey keep the flour barrel full, or Ben. Rent him out to a sideshow; there must be folks somewhere that would
pay a dime to see him, then she cried more and kept say- ing my poor afflicted baby and I says yes he'll be quite a help to you when he gets his growth not being "more
than one and a half times as high as me now and she says she'd be dead soon and then we’d all be better off and so
I says all right, all right, have it your way. It's your
grandchild, which is more than any other grandparents
It's got can say for certain. Only I says it's only a question
of time. If you believe she'll do what she says and not try to see it, you fool yourself because the first time that was
that Mother kept on saying thank God you are not a Compson except in name, because you are all I have left now, you and Maury, and I says well I could spare Uncle
Maury myself and then they came and said they were
ready to start. Mother stopped crying then. She pulled
her veil down and we went down stairs. Uncle Maury
was coming out of the diningroom, his handkerchief to
his mouth. They kind of made a lane and we went out
the door just in time to see Dilsey driving Ben and T. P. back around the comer. We went down the steps and got
in. Uncle Maury kept saying Poor little sister, poor little
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 215
sister, talking around his mouth and patting Mothers
hand. Talking around whatever it was.
‘'Have you got your band on?” she says. “Why dont
they go on, before Benjamin comes out and makes a
spectacle. Poor little boy. He doesn’t know. He cant even
realise.” “There, there,” Uncle Maury says, patting her handj
talking around his mouth. “It’s better so. Let him be un^ aware of bereavement until he has to.” “Other women have their children to support them in times like this,” Mother says. “You have Jason and me,” he says.
“It’s so terrible to me,” she says, “Having the two of them like this, in less than two years.”
“There, there,” he says. After a while he kind of sneaked his hand to his mouth and dropped them out the window. Then I knew what I had been smelling.
Clove stems. I reckon he thought that the least he could
do at Father’s funeral or maybe the sideboard thought it was still Father and tripped him up when he passed.
Like I say, if he had to sell something to send Quentin to Harvard we’d all been a damn sight better off if he’d sold that sideboard and bought himself a one-armed
strait jacket with part of the money. I reckon the reason
all the Compson gave out before it got to me like Mother
says, is that he drank it up. At least I never heard of him offering to sell anything to send me to Harvard.
So he kept on patting her hand and saying “Poor little sister,” patting her hand with one of tlie black gloves that we got the biU for four days later because it was the
twenty-sixth because it was the same day one month that Father went up there and got it and brought it home
and wouldn’t teU anything about where she was or anything
and Mother crying and saying “And you didn’t
^15 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
oven see him? You didn t even try to get him to make any
provision for it?” and Father says No she shall not touch
his money not one cent of it” and Mother says “He can be forced to by law. He can prove nothing, unless—Ja- son Compson,” she says, “Were you fool enough to tell—”
“Hush, Caroline,” Father says, then he sent me to help
Dilsey get that old cradle out of the attic and I says, “Well, they brought my job home tonight” because all the time we kept hoping they’d get things straightened out and he’d keep her because Mother kept saying she
would at least have enough regard for the family not to jeopardize my chance after she and Quentin had had
theirs. “And whar else do she belong?” Dilsey says, “Who
else gwine raise her ’cep me? Aint I raised eve’y one of
y’all?”
“And a damn fine job you made of it,” I says. “Anyway
it’ll give her something to sure enough worry over now.’' So we carried tlie cradle down and Dilsey started to set
it up in her old room. Then Mother started sure enough.
“Hush, Miss Cahline,” Dilsey says, “You gwine wake
her up.” ‘In there?” Mother says, “To be contaminated by that atmosphere? It’ll be hard enough as it is, with the herit- age she already has.” “Hush,” Father says, “Dont be silly.” “Why amt she gwine sleep in here,” Dilsey says, “In
the same room whar I put her ma to bed ev’y night or her hfe since she was big enough to sleep by herself.” “You dont know,” Mother says, “To have my own
daughter cast off by her husband. Poor little innocent
baby,” she says, looking at Quentin, ‘TTou will never know the suffering you’ve caused.”
“Hush Caroline,” Father says.
THE SOTJKD AND THE FURY 217
“What you want to go on like that fo Jason fer?” sey says. "IVe tried to protect lum;’ Mother says. Tve always
tried to protect him from it. At least I can do my best to shield her.’’ "How sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her, I like to know,” Dilsey says.
"I cant help it,” Mother says. "I know I’m just a trou- blesome old woman. But I know that people cannot flout God’s laws with impunity.”
"Nonsense,” Father said. "Fix it in Miss Caroline’s room then, Dilsey.”
"You can say nonsense,” Mother says. "But she must
never know. She must never even learn that name. Dilsey,
I forbid you ever to speak that name in her hearing.
If she could grow up never to know that she had a mother, I would thank God.”
"Dont be a fool,” Father says.
"I have never interfered with the way you brought
them up,” Mother says, "But now I cannot stand any- more. We must decide this now, tonight. Either that name is never to be spoken in her hearing, or she must
go, or I will go. Take your choice.” "Hush,” Father says, "You’re just upset. Fix it in here,
Dilsey.”
"En you’s about sick too,” Dilsey says. "You looks like a hant. You git in bed and I’ll fix you a toddy and see
kin you sleep. I bet you aint had a full night’s sleep since
you lef.” "No,” Mother says, "Dont you know what the doctor
says? Why must you encourage him to drink? That’s what’s the matter with him now. Look at me, I suffei too, but I’m not so weak that I must kill myself witli whiskey.”
-il8 THE SOXJHD AlSrX) THE FXJRY
"Fiddlesticks/^ Father says^ 'What do doctors know?
They make their livings advising people to do whatever
they are not doing at the time, which is the extent of anyone’s
knowledge of the degenerate ape. You’ll </interval><interval value=31 novelty=0.8455 residual=0.0194 level=normal>have a minister
in to hold my hand next.” Then Mother cried, and
he went out. Went down stairs, and then I heard the
sideboard. I woke up and heard him going down again.
Mother had gone to sleep or something, because the
house was quiet at last. He was trying to be quiet too, be- cause I couldn’t hear him, only the bottom of his nightshirt
and his bare legs in front of the sideboard.
Dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her
in it. She never had waked up since he brought her in
the house.
"She pretty near too big fer hit,” Dilsey says. "Dar now.
I gwine spread me a pallet right acrost de hall, so you
wont need to git up in de night.”
"I wont sleep,” Mother says. "You go on home. I wont
mind. I’ll be happy to give the rest of my life to her, if I oan just prevent—
”
"Hush, now,” Dilsey says. "We gwine take keer of her. En you go on to bed too,” she says to me, "You got to go
to school tomorrow.”
So I went out, then Mother called me back and cried on me awhile. ‘Tou are my only hope,” she says. "Every night I tliank God for you.” While we were waiting Acre for them
to start she says Thank God if he had to be taken too, it
is you left me and not Quentin, Thank God you are not a Compson, because all I have left now is you and Maury
and I says, Well I could spare Uncle Maury myself. Well,
he kept on patting her hand with his black glove, talking
away from her. He took them off when his turn with the
shovel came. He got up near the first, where they were
THE SOUKB ANB THE EoEY 215^ holding the umbrellas over them, stamping every now
and then and trying to kick the mud off their feet and
sticking to the shovels so they'd have to knock it off, making a hollow sound when it fell on it, and when I stepped back around the hack I could see him behind a tombstone, taking another one out of a bottle, I thought
he never was going to stop because I had on my new suit too, but it happened that there wasn't much mud on the
wheels yet, only Mother saw it and says I dont know
when youll ever have another one and Uncle Maury
says, ''Now, now. Dont you worry at all. You have me to depend on, always."
And we have. Always. The fourth letter was from him
But there wasn’t any need to open it. I could have writ- ten it myself, or recited it to her from memory, adding
ten dollars just to be safe. But I had a hxmch about that other letter. I just felt that it was about time she was up
to some of her tricks again. She got pretty wise after that
first time. She found out pretty quick that I was a differ- ent breed of cat from Father. When they begun to get it filled up toward the top Mother started crying sure enough, so Uncle Maury got in with her and drove off. He says You can come in with somebody; they’ll be glad
to give you a lift. I’ll have to take your mother on and
I thought about saying, Yes you ought to brought two
bottles instead of just one only I thought about where we were, so I let them go on. Little they cared how wet
I got, because then Mother could have a whale of a time
being afraid I was taking pneumonia.
Well, I got to thinking about that and watching them
throwing dirt into it, slapping it on anyway like they were making mortar or something or building a fence., and I began to feel sort of funny and so I decided to walk around a while. I thought that if I went toward
2 20 THE SOUN’D AND THE FUEY
town they d catch up and be trying to make me get in one of them, so I went on back toward the nigger graveyard.
I got under some cedars, where the rain didn't come much, only dripping now and then, w^here I could
see when they got through and went away. After a while
they were all gone and I waited a minute and came out.
I had to follow the path to keep out of the w^et grass so
I didn't see her until I was pretty near there, standing
there in a black cloak, looking at the flowers. I knew who
it was right off, before she turned and looked at me and
lifted up her veil. ''Hello, Jason," she says, holding out her hand. We
shook hands.
"What are you doing here?" I says. "I thought you
promised her you wouldn't come back here. I thought
you had more sense than that." "Yes?" she says. She looked at the flowers again. There
must have been fifty dollars' worth. Somebody had put
one bunch on Quentin's. "You did?" she says. "I'm not surprised though," I says. "I wouldn't put anything
past you. You dont mind anybody. You dont give a damn about anybody."
"Oh,” she says, "that job." She looked at the grave. "I'm
sorry about that, Jason."
"I bet you are," I says. "You'll talk mighty meek now. But you needn't have come back. There's not anything
left. Ask Uncle Maury, if you dont believe me."
"I dont want anything," she says. She looked at the
grave. "Why didn't they let me know?" she says. "I just
happened to see it in the paper. On the back page. Just happened to." I didn't say anything. We stood there, looking at the
grave, and then I got to thinking about when we were
little and one thing and another and I got to feeHng
THE SOTJKD AND THE PXJEY 221
funny again, kind of mad or something, thinking aboul
now we'd have Uncle Maury around the house all the time, running things like the way he left me to come home in the rain by myself. I says, “A fine lot you care, sneaking in here soon as he's dead.
But it wont do you any good. Dont think that you can
take advantage of this to come sneaking back. If you
cant stay on the horse you've got, you'll have to walk," I says. 'We dont even know your name at that house," I says. "Do you know that? We don't even know you with
him and Quentin," I says. "Do you know that?"
"I know it," she says. "Jason," she says, looking at the grave, "if you'll fix it so I can see her a minute I'll give
you fifty dollars." "You haven’t got fifty dollars," I says. "Will you?” she says, not looking at me.
"Let’s see it," I says. "I dont believe you've got fifty dollars."
I could see where her hands were moving under her
cloak, then she held her hand out. Damn if it wasn't full of money. I could see two or three yellow ones. "Does be still give you money?" I says. "How much
does he send you?”
"I'll give you a hundred," she says. 'Will you?"
"Just a minute," I says, "And just like I say. I wouldn't
have her know it for a thousand dollars." "Yes," she says. "Just like you say do it. Just so I see her
a minute, I wont beg or do anything. I'll go right on away."
"Give me the money," I says.
"I'll give it to you afterward," she says. "Dont you trust me?" I says. "No,” she says. "I know you. I grew up with you
" "You're a fine one to talk about trusting people,” I says*

Well,” I says, ‘1 got to get on out of the rain. Goodbye.**
I made to go away.
‘"Jason,” she says. I stopped.
‘"Yes?” I says. ""Hurry up. Im getting wet.”
‘"All right,” she says. “Here.” There wasn t anybody in
sight. I went back and took the money. She still held to
it. "Ton’ll do it?” she says, looking at me from under the
veil, "Ton promise?”
“Let go,” I says, "Tou want somebody to come along
and see us?”
She let go. I put the money in my pocket. “Youll do it, [ason?” she says. “I wouldn’t ask you, if there was any
other way.”
"Tou re damn right there’s no other way,” I says. “Sure
ni do it. I said I would, didn’t I? Only you’ll have to do
just like I say, now.”
'Tes,” she says, “I will.” So I told her where to be, and
went to the livery stable. I hurried and got there just as they were unhitching the hack. I asked if they had paid
for it yet and he said No and I said Mrs Compson forgot
something and wanted it again, so they let me take it. Mink was driving. I bought him a cigar, so we drove
around until it begun to get dark on the back streets where they wouldn’t see him. Then Mink said he’d have
to take the team on back and so I said I’d buy him another
cigar and so we drove into the lane and I went
across the yard to the house. I stopped in the hall until I could hear Mother and Uncle Maury upstairs, then I went on back to the kitchen. She and Ben were there with
Dilsey. I said Mother wanted her and I took her into the
house. I found Uncle Maury’s raincoat and put it around
her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got
In the hack. I told Mink to drive to the depot. He was
afraid to pass the stable, so we had to go the back way
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 225
and I saw her standing on the comer under the light and
I told Mink to drive close to the walk and when I said
Go on, to give the team a bat Then I took the raincoat
off of her and held her to the window and Caddy saw
her and sort of jumped forward.
"Hit ’em, Mink!” I says, and Mink gave them a cut and
we went past her like a fire engine. "Now get on that
train like you promised,” I says. I could see her mnning
after us dirough tlie back window. "Hit ’em again,” 1
says, "Let’s get on home.” When we turned the corner she was still running.
And so I counted the money again that night and put
it away, and I didn’t feel so bad. I says I reckon that’ll show you. I reckon you’ll know now that you cant beat
me out of a job and get away with it. It never occurred
to me she wouldn’t keep her promise and take that train. But I didn’t know much about them then; I didn’t have
any more sense than to believe what they said, because
the next morning damn if she didn’t walk right into the
store, only she had sense enough to wear the veil and not speak to anybody. It was Saturday morning, because I was at the store, and she came right on back to the desk
where I was, walking fast. ‘Xiar,” she says, ‘Xiar.” "Are you crazy?” I says. 'What do you mean? coming
in here Hke this?” She started in, but I shut her off. I says, "You already cost me one job; do you want me to lose
this one too? If you’ve got anything to say to me, I’ll meet you somewhere after dark. What have you got to say to me?” I says, "Didn’t I do everything I said? I said see her a minute, didn’t I? Well, didn’t you?” She just
stood there looking at me, shaking like an ague-fit, her
hands clenched and kind of jer</interval><interval value=32 novelty=0.8021 residual=-0.0231 level=normal>king. "I did just what I said I would,” I says, "You’re the one that Hed. You prom^

ised to take that train. Didn’t you Didn’t you promise?
If you think you can get that money back, just try it,” I says. 'If it’d been a thousand dollars, you’d still owe me
after the risk I took. And if I see or hear you’re still in town after number 17 runs,” I says, 'I’ll tell Mother and
Uncle Maury. Then hold your breath until you see her
again.” She just stood there, looking at me, twisting her
hands together.
"Damn you,” she says, "Damn you.”
"Sure,” I says, "That’s all right too. Mind what I say, now. After number 17, and I tell them.”
After she was gone I felt better. I says I reckon you’ll
think twice before you deprive me of a job that was
promised me. I was a kid then. I believed folks when
they said they’d do things. I’ve learned better since. Besides,
like I say I guess I dont need any man’s help to get
along I can stand on my own feet like I always have.
Then all of a sudden I thought of Dilsey and Uncle
Mauiy. I thought how she’d get around Dilsey and that
Uncle Maury would do anything for ten dollars. And
there I was, couldn’t even get away from the store to protect
my own Mother. Like she says, if one of you had to be taken, thank God it was you left me I can depend on you and I says well I dont reckon I’ll ever get far enough
from the store to get out of your reach. Somebody’s got
to hold on to what little we have left, I reckon.
So as soon as I got home I fixed Dilsey. I told Dilsey
she had leprosy and I got the bible and read where a
man’s flesh rotted oflF and I told her that if she ever looked at her or Ben or Quentin they’d catch it too. So I thought I had everything all fixed until that day when I came home and found Ben bellowing. Raising hell and
nobody could quiet him. Mother said. Well, get him the
slipper then. Dilsey made out she didn’t hear. Mother
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 22J
said it again and I says Td go I couldn't stand that damn
noise. Like I say I can stand lots of things I dont expect
much from them but if I have to work all day long in a damn store damn if I dont think I deserve a little peace
and quiet to eat dinner in. So I says I'd go and Dilsey
says quick, ''J^son!” Well, like a flash I knew what was up, but just to make sure I went and got the slipper and brought it back,
and just like I thought, when he saw it you'd drought we
were kilhng him. So I made Dilsey own up, then I told Mother. We had to take her up to bed then, and after things got quieted dovm a little I put the fear of God into Dilsey. As much as you can into a nigger, that is. That's
the trouble with nigger servants, when they've been with
you for a long time they get so fuU of self importance
that they’re not worth a damn. Think they run the whole
family.
“I like to know whut's de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby," Dilsey says. "If Mr Jason was still here hit ud be different." ""Only Mr Jason’s not here," I says. ""I know you wont
pay me any mind, but I reckon you'll do what Mother
says. You keep on worrying her like this until you get her
into the graveyard too, then you can fill the whole house
full of ragtag and bobtail. But what did you want to let that damn idiot see her for?"
""You’s a cold man, Jason, if man you is,” she says. ""I thank de Lawd I got mo heart dan dat, even ef hit is black.”
""At least I’m man enough to keep that flour barrel fuU,’^ I says. ""And if you do that again, you wont be eating out
of it either." So the next time I told her that if she tried Dilsey
again. Mother was going to fire Dilsey and send Ben to
226 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
Jackson and take Quentin and go away. She looked at me for a while. There wasn’t any street light close and I couldn’t see her face much. But I could feel her looking
at me. When we were little when she’d get mad and
couldn’t do anything about it her upper lip would begin
to jump. Everytime it jumped it would leave a little more
of her teeth showing, and all the time she’d be as still as a post, not a muscle moving except her lip jerking
higher and higher up her teeth. But she didn’t say anything.
She just said,
‘'All right. How much?”
“Well, if one look through a hack window was worth
a hundred,” I says. So after that she behaved pretty well,
only one time she asked to see a statement of the bank
account.
“I know they have Mother’s indorsement on them,” she
says, “But I want to see the bank statement. I want to see myself where those checks go.” “That’s in Mothers private business,” I says. “If you
think you have any right to pry into her private affairs
I’ll tell her you believe those checks are being misappropriated
and you want an audit because you dont trust
her.” She didn’t say anything or move. I could hear her
whispering Damn you oh damn you oh damn you.
“Say it out,” I says, “I dont reckon it’s any secret what
you and I think of one another. Maybe you want the
money back,” I says. “Listen, Jason,” she says, “Dont lie to me now. About
her. I wont ask to see anything. If that isn’t enough. I’ll send more each month. Just promise that she’ll—^that she—^You can do that. Things for her. Be kind to her.
Little things that I cant, they wont let. . . . But you
wont. You never had a drop of warm blood in you. Lis-

ten/' she says, "If you 11 get Mother to let me have her
bach. 111 give you a thousand dollars/"
"You haven't got a thousand dollars/" I says, "I know
you're lying now.”
"Yes I have. I will have. I can get it."" "And I know how you'll get it,'" I says, "Youll get it the same way you got her. And when she gets big
enough— Then I thought she really was going to hit at me, and then I didn't know what she was going to do. She acted for a minute like some kind of a toy that's wound up too tight and about to burst all to pieces.
"Oh, I'm crazy,” she says, "I'm insane. I can't take her. Keep her. What am I thinking of. Jason,” she says, grabbing
my arm. Her hands were hot as fever. ‘Tfon’ll have
to promise to take care of her, to—She's kin to you; your
own flesh and blood. Promise, Jason. You have Father's name: do you think I'd have to ask him twice? once, even?”
"That's so,” I says, "He did leave me something. What
do you want me to do,” I says, "Buy an apron and a gocart?
I never got you into this,” I says. "I run more risk than you do, because you haven't got anything at stake. So if you expect—^'' "No,” she says, then she begun to laugh and to try to hold it back all at the same time. "No. I have nothing at
stake,” she says, making that noise, putting her hands to her moutli, "Nuli-nuh-nothing,” she says. "Here,” I says, ''Stop that!” "I'm trying to,” she says, holding her hands over her
mouth. "Oh God, oh God.”
"Tm going away from here,” I says, "I cant be seen
here. You get on out of town now, you hear?”
‘Wait,” she says, catching my arm. "I've stopped. I wont again. You promise, Jason?” she says, and me feel-
Ztn THE SOUND AND THE FURY
ing her eyes almost like they were touching my face, ‘"You promise? Mother—^that money—if sometimes she
needs things—If I send checks for her to you, other ones
besides those, youll give them to her? You wont tell? You’ll see that she has things like other girls?”
"‘Sure,” I says, '‘As long as you behave and do like I tell you.”
And so when Earl came up front with his hat on he
says, 'Tm going to step up to Rogers’ and get a snack.
We wont have time to go home to dinner, I reckon.”
"What’s the matter we wont have time?” I says. "With this show in town and all,” he says. "They’re going
to give an afternoon performance too, and they’ll all want to get done trading in time to go to it. So we’d
better just run up to Rogers.”
"All right,” I says, "It’s yom' stomach. If you want to make a slave of yourself to your business, it’s all right
with me.”
"I reckon you’ll never be a slave to any business,” he
says. "Not unless it’s Jason Compson’s business,” I says. So when I went back and opened it the only thing that
surprised me was it was a money order not a check. Yes,
sir. You cant trust a one of them. After all the risk I’d taken, risking Mother finding out about her coming down
here once or twice a year sometimes, and me having to
tell Mother lies about it. That’s gratitude for you. And I wouldn’t put it past her to try to notify the postoffice not
to let anyone except her cash it. Giving a kid like that
fifty dollars. Why I never saw fifty dollars until I was
twenty-one years old, with all the other boys vdth the
afternoon off and all day Saturday and me working in a
store. Like I say, how can they expect anybody to control
her, with her giving her money behind our backs. She
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 229
has the same home you had I says, and the same raising.
I reckon Mother is a better judge of what she needs than
you are, that haven’t even got a home. 'If you want to give her money/’ I says, "You send it to Mother, dont be
giving it to her. If I’ve got to run this risk every few
months, you’ll have to do like I say, or it’s out.” And just about the time I got ready to begin on it be- cause if Earl thought I was going to dash up the street and gobble two bits worth of indigestion on his account
he was bad fooled. I may not be sitting with my feet on a mahogany desk but I am being paid for what I do inside
this building and if I can manage to live a civilised life outside of it I’ll go where I can. I can stand on my own
feet; I dont need any man’s mahogany desk to prop me
up. So just about the time I got ready to start I’d have
to drop everything and run to sell some redneck a dime’s
worth of nails or something, and Earl up there gobbling a sandwich and half way back already, hke as not, and
then I found that all the blanks were gone. I remembered
then that I had aimed to get some more, but it was too
late now, and then I looked up and there Quentin came.
In the back door. I heard her asking old Job if I was
there. I just had time to stick them in the drawer and</interval><interval value=33 novelty=0.8201 residual=-0.0042 level=normal>
close it. She came aroxmd to the desk. I looked at my watch.
"You been to dinner already?” I says. "It’s just twelve;
I just heard it strike. You must have flown home and
back.”
"I’m not going home to dinner,” she says. "Did I get a
letter today?”
"Were you expecting one?” I says. “Have you got a sweetie that can write?”
"From Mother,” she says. "Did I get a letter from
Mother?” she says, looking at me.
2^0 the sound and the fuey
"Mother got one from her/' I says. "I haven't opened
it. You 11 have to wait until she opens it. Shell let you see
it, I imagine."
"Please, Jason” she says, not paying any attention,
"Did I get one?”
"What's the matter?” I says. "I never knew you to be
this anxious about anybody. You must expect some money from her.” "She said she— she says. ‘Tlease, Jason/' she says, "Did I?” "You must have been to school today, after all,” I says, "Somewhere where they taught you to say please. Wait
a minute, while I wait on that customer.”
I went and waited on him. When I turned to come
back she was out of sight behind the desk. I ran. I ran around the desk and caught her as she jerked her hand
out of the drawer, I took the letter away from her, beating
her knuckles on the desk until she let go.
'Tfou would, would you?” I says. Give it to me,” she says, "You’ve already opened it. Give it to me. Please, Jason. It’s mine. I saw the name.”
"I'll take a hame string to you,” I says. 'That’s what I’ll give you. Going into my papers.”
"Is there some money in it?” she says, reaching for it. "She said she would send me some money. She promised
she would. Give it to me.”
"What do you want with money?” I says. "She said she would,” she says, "Give it to me. Please,
Jason. I wont ever ask you anything again, if you’ll give
it to me this time.” "I’m going to, if you’ll give me time,” I says. I took the
letter and the money order out and gave her the letter. She reached for the money order, not hardly glancing at the letter. "You’ll have to sign it first,” I says.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 231
^"How much is it?” she says. "Read the letter ” I says. "I reckon it’ll say.”
She read it fast, in about two looks.
"It dont say,” she says, looking up. She dropped the
letter to the floor. "How much is it?”
"It’s ten dollars,” I says. "Ten dollars?” she says, staring at me. "And you ought to be damn glad to get that,” I says, "A kid like you. What are you in such a rush for money
aU of a sudden for?” "Ten dollars?” she says, like she was talking in her
sleep, "Just ten dollars?” She made a grab at the money
order. "You’re lying,” she says. "Thief!” she says, "Thieff
“You would, would you?” I says, holding her off. "Give it to me!” she says, "It’s mine. She sent it to me. I will see it. I will.” "You will?” I says, holding her, "How’re you going to do it?” "Just let me see it, Jason,” she says, ""Please. I wont ask
you for anything again.”
""Think I’m lying, do you?” I says. ""Just for that you
wont see it.” ""But just ten dollars,” she says, ""She told me she—she
told me—^Jason, please please please. I’ve got to have some money. I’ve just got to. Give it to me, Jason. I’ll do anything if you will.” ""TeU me what you’ve got to have money for,” I says.
""I’ve got to have it,” she says. She was looking at me. Then all of a sudden she quit looking at me without
moving her eyes at all. I knew she was going to lie. "It’s some money I owe,” she says. ""I’ve got to pay it. I’ve got
to pay it today.”
""Who to?” I says. Her hands were sort of twisting. I could watch her trying to think of a lie to tell. "Have you
2}2 THE SOUND aNB THE FURY
been charging things at stores again?” I says. ‘Tou
needn t bother to tell me that. If you can find anybody
in this town that’ll charge anything to you after what I told them, 111 eat it.” “Its a girl,” she says, “Its a girl. I borrowed some money from a girl. IVe got to pay it back. Jason, give it to me. Please. Ill do anything. IVe got to have it. Mother
wiU pay you. Ill write to her to pay you and that I wont
ever ask her for anything again. You can see the letter. Please, Jason. IVe got to have it.” “Tell me what you want with it, and I’ll see about it,” I says. “Tell me.” She just stood there, with her hands
working against her dress. “All right,” I says, “If ten dollars
is too little for you. I’ll just take it home to Mother,
and you know what’ll happen to it then. Of course, if you’re so rich you dont need ten dollars
—
She stood there, looking at the floor, kind of mumbling
to herself. “She said she would send me some money.
She said she sends money here and you say she dont send
any. She said she’s sent a lot of money here. She says it’s for me. That it’s for me to have some of it. And you say
we haven’t got any money.”
“You know as much about that as I do,” I says. “YouVe
seen what happens to those checks.”
“Yes,” she says, looking at the floor. “Ten dollars,” she
says, “Ten dollars.” “And you’d better thank your stars it’s ten dollars,” I
says. “Here,” I says. I put the money order face down on
the desk, holding my hand on it, “Sign it.” “Will you let me see it?” she says. “I just want to look
at it. Whatever it says, I wont ask for but ten dollars. You
can have the rest. I just want to see it.” “Not after the way youVe acted,” I says. “YouVe got to leam one thing, and that is that when I tell you to do
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 233
something, youVe got it to do. You sign your name on
that line.'' She took the pen, but instead of signing it she just
stood there with her head bent and the pen shaking in her hand. Just like her mother. ‘'‘Oh, God," she says, '‘oh, God.”
"Yes," I says, "That's one thing you'll have to learn if you never learn anything else. Sign it now, and get on
out of here.” She signed it. "Where's the money?" she says. I took
the order and blotted it and put it in my pocket. Then I gave her the ten dollars. "Now you go on back to school this afternoon, you
hear?” I says. She didn't answer. She crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or something and went
on out the front door just as Earl came in. A customer came in with him and they stopped up front. I gathered
up the things and put on my hat and went up front. "Been much busy?” Earl says. "Not much,” I says. He looked out the door. "That your car over yonder?" he says. "Better not try tc go out home to dinner. We'll likely have another rush
just before the show opens. Get you a lunch at Rogers'
and put a ticket in the drawer.”
"Much obliged," I says. "I can still manage to feed myself,
I reckon.”
And right there he’d stay, watching that door like a hawk until I came through it again. Well, he'd just have
to watch it for a while; I was doing the best I could. The
time before I says that's die last one now; you'll have to remember to get some more right away. But who can re- member anything in all this hurrah. And now this damn
show had to come here the one day I’d have to hunt all over town for a blank check, besides all the other things
234 THE SOUHD AND THE ^'JRY
I had to do to keep the house running, and Earl
watching the door like a hawk.
I went to the printing shop and told him I wanted to play a joke on a fellow, but he didn't have anything.
Then he told me to have a look in the old opera house,
where somebody had stored a lot of papers and junk out
of the old Merchants' and Farmers' Bank when it failed, so I dodged up a few more alleys so Earl couldn't see me
and finally found old man Simmons and got the key from
him and went up there and dug around. At last I found
a pad on a Saint Louis bank. And of course she'd pick
this one time to look at it close. Well, it would have to
do. I couldn't waste any more time now.
I went back to the store. "'Forgot some papers Mother
wants to go to the bank," I says. I went back to the desk
and fixed the check. Trying to hurry and all, I says to myself it's a good thing her eyes are giving out, with that
little whore in the house, a Christian forbearing woman
like Mother. I says you know just as well as I do what
she's going to grow up into but I says that's your business,
if you want to keep her and raise her in your house
just because of Father. Then she would begin to cry and
say it was her own flesh and blood so I just says All
right. Have it your way. I can stand it if you can.
I fixed the letter up again and glued it back and went
out."Try not to be gone any longer tlian you can help,"
Earl says. "All right," I says, I went to the telegraph oflBce. The
smart boys were all there. "Any of you boys made your million yet?" I says. "Who can do anything, with a market like that?" Doc
says. "What's it doing?" I says. I went in and looked. It was
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 235
three points under the opening. ""You boys are not going
to let a httle thing like the cotton market beat you, are you?” I says. "‘I thought you were too smart for that.” “Smart, hell,” Doc says. “It was down twelve points at twelve o'clock. Cleaned me out.” “Twelve points?” I says. "Why the hell didn’t some- body let me know? Why didn’t you let me know?” I says to the operator.
‘"I take it as it comes in,” he says. ""I’m not running a bucket shop.”
""You’re smart, aren’t you?” I says. ""Seems to me, with
the money I spend with you, you could take time to call me up. Or maybe your damn company’s in a conspiracy
with those damn eastern sharks.” He didn’t say anything. He made like he was busy.
""You’re getting a little too big for your pants,” I says. “First thing you know you’ll be working for a living.”
"What’s the matter with you?” Doc says. ""You’re still three points to the good.”
“Yes,” I says, “If I happened to be selling. I haven’t
mentioned that yet, I think. You boys all cleaned out?”
“I got caught twice,” Doc says. ""I switched just in time.”
"Well,” I. O. Snopes says, ""I’ve picked hit; I reckon
taint no more than fair fer hit to pick me once in a
while.”
So I left them buying and seUing among themselves at a nickel a point. I found a nigger and sent him for my
car and stood on the comer and</interval><interval value=34 novelty=0.7934 residual=-0.03 level=normal> waited. I couldn’t see Earl looking up and down the street, vdth one eye on
the clock, because I couldn’t see the door from here. After
about a week he got back with it. ""Where the hell have you been?” I says, ""Riding
around where the wenches could see you?”
2}6 THE SOUND AND THE F U ii Y
'1 come straight as I could/' he says, '1 had to drive
clean around the square, wid all dem wagons."
I never found a nigger yet that didn't have an airtight
alibi for whatever he did. But just turn one loose in a car and he's bound to show oflF. I got in and went on around
the square. I caught a glimpse of Earl in the door across the square.
I went straight to the kitchen and told Dilsey to hurry
ijp with dinner. '"Quentin aint come yit," she says. "'V^at of that?" I says. "You'll be telling me next that
Luster’s not quite ready to eat yet. Quentin knows when
meals aie served in this house. Hurry up with it, now."
Mother was in her room. I gave her the letter. She
opened it and took the check out and sat holding it in her hand. I went and got the shovel from the corner and
gave her a match. "Come on," I says, "Get it over with.
You'll be crying in a minute."
She took the match, but she didn't strike it. She sat
there, looking at the check. Just like I said it would be.
"I hate to do it," she says, "To increase your burden by
adding Quentin. . , "I guess we'll get along," I says. "Come on. Get it over
with.”
But she just sat there, holding the check. "This one is on a different bank,” she says. "They have
been on an IndianapoHs bank."
"Yes,” I says. "Women are allowed to do that too." "Do what?" she says. "Keep money in two different banks," I says. "Oh,” she says. She looked at the check a while. "I'm
glad to know she's so . . . she has so much . . . God
sees that I am doing right," she says. 'Come on,” I says, "Finish it. Get the fun over."
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 237
"Fun?” she says, "When I think
—
"I thought you were burning this two hundred dollars a month for fun,” I says. "Come on, now. Want me to
strike the match?”
"I could bring myself to accept them,” she says, "For
my children’s sake. I have no pride.”
"You’d never be satisfied,” I says, "You know you
wouldn’t. You’ve settled that once, let it stay settled. We
can get along.”
"I leave everything to you,” she says. "But sometimes I become afraid that in doing this I am depriving you all of what is rightfully yours. Perhaps I shall be punished
for it. If you want me to, I will smother my pride and
accept them.”
‘What would be the good in beginning now, when

dollars. We’ve got along so far, haven’t we?” I says.
"I haven’t seen you in the poorhouse yet.”
"Yes,” she says, "We Bascombs need nobody’s charity.
Certainly not that of a fallen woman.”
She struck the match and ht the check and put it in the shovel, and then the envelope, and watched them
burn.
“You dont know what it is,” she says, "Thank God you
will never know what a mother feels.” "There are lots of women in this world no better than
her,” I says. "But they are not my daughters,” she says. "It’s not myself,”
she says, "I’d gladly take her back, sins and all, be- cause she is my flesh and blood. It’s for Quentin’s sake
” Well, I could have said it wasn’t much chance of anybody
hurting Quentin much, but Kke I say I dont expect

women squabbling and crying in the house.
"And yours,” she says. "I know how you feel toward
her.” "Let her come back,” I says, "far as I m concerned.”
"No,” she says. "I owe that to your father s memory.”
'When he was trying all the time to persuade you to
let her come home when Herbert threw her out?” I says. "You dont understand,” she says. "I know you dont
intend to make it more diflScult for me. But it’s my place
to suffer for my children,” she says. "I can bear it.” "Seems to me you go to a lot of unnecessary trouble
doing it,” I says. The paper burned out. I carried it to the
grate and put it in. "It just seems a shame to me to bum
up good money,” I says. "Let me never see the day when my children will have
to accept that, the wages of sin,” she says. "I’d rather see even you dead in your coffin first,” "Have it your way,” I says. "Are we going to have din- ner soon?” I says, "Because if we’re not, I’ll have to go on
back. We’re pretty busy today.” She got up. "IVe told
her once,” I says. "It seems she’s waiting on Quentin or Luster or somebody. Here, I’ll call her. Wait.” But she
went to the head of the stairs and called. "Quentin aint come yit,” Dilsey says. "Well, I’ll have to get on back,” I says. "I can get a sandwich downtown. I dont want to interfere with Dilsey’s
arrangements,” I says. Well, that got her started
again, with Dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and
forth, saying,
"All right, all right, Ise puttin hit on fast as I kin.”
"I try to please you aU,” Mother says, "I try to make
things as easy for you as I can.”

"Tm not complaining, am I?” I says. "Have I said a word except I had to go back to work?’’
"I know,” she says, "I know you haven’t had the chance
the others had, that you’ve had to bury yourself in a
little country store. I wanted you to get ahead. I knew
your father would never realise that you were the only one who had any business sense, and then when everything
else failed I believed that when she married, and
Herbert . . . after his promise . . "Well, he was probably lying too,” I says. "He may not have even had a bank. And if he had, I dont reckon he’d
have to come all the way to Mississippi to get a man for
it.”We ate awhile. I could hear Ben in the kitchen, where
Luster was feeding him. Like I say, if we’ve got to feed
another mouth and she wont take that money, why not
send him down to Jackson. He’ll be happier there, with
people like him. I says God knows there’s little enough room for pride in this family, but it dont take much pride
to not like to see a thirty year old man playing around
the yard with a nigger boy, running up and down the
fence and lowing like a cow whenever they play goM
over there. I says if they’d sent him to Jackson at first we’d all be better oflE today. I says, you’ve done your
duty by him; you’ve done all anybody can expect of you

there and get that much benefit out of the taxes we pay*

even if I dont always know where they come from.
We ate for awhile. Mother sent Dilsey to the front to look for Quentin again.
'T keep telling you she’s not coming to dinner,” I says.
*'She knows better than that,” Mother says, “She knows
I dont permit her to run about the streets and not come
home at meal time. Did you look good, Dilsey?”
“Dont let her, then,” I says. “What can I do,” she says, “You have all of you flouted

“If you wouldn’t come interfering, I’d make her mind,”
I says. “It wouldn’t take me but about one day to straighten her out*” “You’d be too brutal with her,” she says. ^TTou have
your Uncle Maury’s temper.”
That reminded me of the letter. I took it out
and handed it to her. “You wont have to open it,” I says. “The bank will let you know how much it is this time.”
“It’s addressed to you,” she says. “Go on and open it,” I says. She opened it and read it and handed it to me.

“It s your money,” I says. “If you want to throw it to the birds even, it’s your business.” “He’s my own brother,” Mother says. “He’s the last Bascomb.
When we are gone there wont be any more of

“That’ll be hard on somebody, I guess,” I says. “All

“I could make it easier right now,” I says. “All right,

“I’ll take your bank book,” I says. “I’ll draw my

'1 just couldn’t bear to have you lose the little I had to invest for you,” she says. Tve often thought that Earl is not a good business man. I know he doesn’t take you
into his confidence to the extent that your investment
in the business should warrant. I’m going to speak to him.”
‘'No, you let him alone,” I says. "It’s his business.” "You have a thousand dollars in it.” ‘TTou let him alone,” I says, "I’m watching things, i have your power of attorney. It’ll be all right.”
"You dont know what a comfort you are to me,” she
says. "You have always been my pride and joy, but when
you came to me of your own accord and insisted on banking your salary each month in my name, I thanked
God it was you left me if they had to be taken.” "They were all right,” I says. "They did the best they
could, I reckon.”
"When you talk that way I know you are thinking bit- terly of your fathers memory,” she says. "You have a

I got up. "If you’ve got any crying to do,” I says, "you’ll
have to do it alone, because I’ve got to get on back. I’ll get the bank book.”
"I’U get it,” she says. "Keep still,” I says, "I’ll get it.” I went upstairs and got
the bank book out of her desk and went back to town.
I went to the bank and deposited the check and the
money order and the other ten, and stopped at the tele- graph office. It was one point above the opening. I had
already lost thirteen points, aU because she had to come
helling in there at twelve, worrying me about that letter„ "What time did that report come in?” I says.

‘‘About an hour ago ” he says. “An hour ago?” I says. “What are we paying you for?** I says, “Weekly reports? How do you expect a man to do

changed that law making folks play the cotton market.”
“They have,” I says. “I hadn’t heard. They must have
sent the news out over the Western Union.”
I went back to the store. Thirteen points. Damn if I believe anybody knows anything about the damn thing
except the ones that sit back in those New York oflSces and watch the country suckers come up and beg them to take their money. Well, a man that just calls shows he
has no faith in himself, and like I say if you aren’t going
to take the advice, what’s the use in paying money for it. Besides, these people are right up there on the ground;
they know everything that’s going on. I could feel the
telegram ia my pocket. I’d just have to prove that they were using the telegraph company to defraud. That
would constitute a bucket shop. And I wouldn’t hesitate
that long, either. Only be damned if it doesn’t look like a company as big and rich as the Western Union could
get a market report out on time. Half as quick as they’ll

say anything until the customer was gone. Then he says, “You go home to dinner?”

IVe found that when a man gets into a rut the best thing
you can do is let him stay there. And when a man gets it in his head dbat he’s got to tell something on you for your own good, good-night, Im glad I haven’t got the
sort of conscience IVe got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time. If Td ever be as careful over anything as he is to keep his little shirt tail full of business from making
him more than eight percent. I reckon he thinks they’d
get him on the usury law if he netted more than eight
percent. What the hell chance has a man got, tied down
in a town like this and to a business like this. Why I could take his business in one year and fix him so he’d never have to work again, only he’d give it all away to the church or something. If there’s one thing gets under
my skin, it’s a damn hypocrite. A man that thinks anything
he dont understand all about must be crooked and
that first chance he gets he’s morally bound to tell the
third party what’s none of his business to tell. Like I say
if I thought every time a man did something I didn’t
know all about he was bound to be a crook, I reckon I wouldn’t have any trouble finding something back there on those books that you wouldn’t see any use for running
and telling somebody I thought ought to know about it, when for all I knew they might know a damn sight more
about it now than I did, and if they didn’t it was damn
little of my business anyway and he says, ''My books are open to anybody. Anybody that has any claim or believes
she has any claim on this business can go back
there and welcome.”
"Sure, you wont tell,” I says, "You couldn’t square your
conscience with that. You’ll just take her back there and
let her find it. You wont tell, yourself.” "I’m not trying to meddle in your business,” he says. "I know you nissed out on some things Hke Quentin had.

But your mother has had a misfortunate life too, and if she was to come in here and ask me why you quit, Td

his ledgers dont square. And Im not going to lie to anybody,
for myself or anybody else.” ‘Well, then,” I says, “I reckon that conscience of yours
is a more valuable clerk than I am; it dont have to gcf home at noon to eat. Only dont let it interfere with my'
appetite,” I says, because how the hell can I do anything
right, with that damn family and her not making any
effort to control her nor any of them, like that time when
she happened to see one of them kissing Caddy and all next day she went around the house in a black dress and
a veil and even Father couldn’t get her to say a word ex- cept crying and saying her little daughter was dead and
Caddy about fifteen then only in three years she’d been
wearing haircloth or probably sandpaper at that rate. Do

streets with every drummer that comes to town, I says, and them telling the new ones up and down the road

"Whut dey give Mr Buck ten dollars fer?” he says. "For the privilege of showing here,” I says. "You can
put the balance of what they’ll spend in your eye.”
"You mean dey pays ten dollars jest to give dey show

alley and saw her. When I stepped back and looked at my watch I didn’t notice at the time who he was because
I was looking at the watch. It was just two thirty, fortyfive
minutes before anybody but me expected her to be
out. So when I looked around the door the first thing I saw was the red tie he had on and I was thinking what
the hell kind of a man would wear a red tie. But she was
sneaking along the alley, watching the door, so I wasn’t thinking anything about him until they had gone past. I was wondering if she’d have so little respect for me that she’d not only play out of school when I told her not to but would walk right past the store, daring me not to see
her. Only she couldn’t see into the door because the sun
fell straight into it and it was like trying to see through an automobile searchlight, so I stood there and watched
her go on past, with her face painted up like a damn
clown’s and her hair all gummed and twisted and a dress that if a woman had come out doors even on Gayoso or Beale street when I was a young fellow with no more
than that to cover her legs and behind, she’d been
thrown in jail. I’ll be damned if they dont dress like they were trying to make every man they passed on the street want to reach out and clap his hand on it. And so I was
thinking what kind of a damn man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden I knew he was one of those show
the soxjkb axb the fxtby
folks well as if she’d told me. Well, I can stand a lot; if I couldn’t, damn if I wouldn’t be in a hell of a fix, so when they turned the comer I jumped down and fol- lowed, Me, without any hat, in the middle of the after- noon, having to chase up and down back alleys because
of my mother’s good name. Like I say you cant do anything
with a woman like that, if she’s got it in her. If it’s in her blood, you cant do anything with her. The only
thing you can do is to get rid of her, let her go on and
live with her own sort. I went on to the street, but they were out of sight.
And there I was, without any hat, looking like I was
cra2y too. Like a man would naturally think, one of them is crazy and another one drowned himself and the
other one was turned out into the street by her husband,
what’s the reason the rest of them are not crazy too. All the time I could see them watching me like a hawk, waiting
for a chance to say Well I’m not surprised I expected
it all the time the whole family’s crazy. Selling land to send him to Harvard and paying taxes to support a state University all the time that I never saw except twice at a
baseball game and not letting her daughter’s name be
spoken on the place until after a while Father wouldn’t even come down town anymore but just sat there all day

She had dodged out of sight somewhere. Saw me coming
and dodged into another alley, running up and down
the alleys with a damn show man in a red tie that every- body would look at and think what kind of a damn man
would wear a red tie. Well, the boy kept speaking to me
and so I took the telegram without knowing I had taken
it. I didn’t realise what it was until I was signing for it, and I tore it open without even caring much what it was.
I knew all the time what it would be, I reckon. That was
the only thing else that could happen, especially holding
it up until I had already had the check entered on the

Damn little time to do anything in, but then I am used

"It’s after three,” she says. "I heard the clock strike at
least a half an hour ago. She ought to be home by now,”
"Ought she?” I says. "When have you ever seen her
before dark?”
"She ought to be home,” she says. ‘When I was a
girl . . “You had somebody to make you behave yourself,” I
says. "She hasn’t.” "I can t do anything with her,” she says. "I’ve tried and
IVe tried.” "And you wont let me, for some reason,” I says, "So
you ought to be satisfied.” I went on to my room. I turned
the key easy and stood there until the knob turned. Then
she says, "Jason,”
‘What,” I says. "I just thought something was wrong.”
"Not in here,” I says. "You’ve come to the wrong place.”
"I dont mean to worry you,” she says. "I’m glad to hear that,” I says. "I wasn’t sure. I thought
1 might have been mistaken. Do you want anything?”
After awhile she says, "No. Not any thing,” Then she
went away. I took the box down and counted out the
money and hid the box again and unlocked the door and
went out. I thought about the camphor, but it would be
THE SOUND AND ThE FUEY 255
too late now, anyway. And Td just have one more round
trip. She was at her door, waiting.
'You want anything from town?” I says. ‘‘No,” she says. “I dont mean to meddle in your aflFairs. But I dont know what Td do if anything happened to you, Jason.” ‘Tm all right,” I says. “Just a headache.”
“I wish you'd take some aspirin,” she says. “I know
youre not going to stop using the car.” “What's the car got to do with it?” I says. “How can a car give a man a headache?”
“You know gasoline always made you sick,” she says. “Ever since you were a child. I wish you'd take some
aspirin.”
“Keep on wishing it,” I says. “It wont hurt you.”
I got in the car and started back to town. I had just
turned onto the street when I saw a ford coming helling
toward me. AJl of a sudden it stopped. I could hear the
wheels sliding and it slewed around and backed and
whirled and just as I was thinking what the hell they were up to, I saw that red tie. Then I recognised her face
looking back through the window. It whirled into the
alley. I saw it turn again, but when I got to the back
street it was just disappearing, running like hell. I saw red. When I recognised that red tie, after all I had told her, I forgot about everything. I never thought
about my head even until I came to the first forks and
had to stop. Yet we spend money and spend money on
roads and damn if it isn't like trying to drive over a
sheet of corrugated iron roofing. I'd like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even a wheelbarrow.
I think too much of my car; I'm not going to hammer it to pieces like it was a ford. Chances were they
had stolen it, anyway, so why should they give a damn
256 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
Like I say blood always tells. If you’ve got blood like that in you, you’ll do anything. I says whatever claim you
believe she has on you has already been discharged; I says from now on you have only yourself to blame be- cause you know what any sensible person would do. I says if I’ve got to spend half my time being a damn detective,
at least I’ll go where I can get paid for it. So I had to stop there at the forks. Then I remembered
it. It felt hke somebody was inside with a hammer, beating
on it. I says I’ve tried to keep you from being worried
by her; I says far as I’m concerned, let her go to hell
as fast as she pleases and the sooner the better. I says what else do you expect except every drummer and
cheap show that comes to town because even these town
jellybeans give her the go-by now. You dont know what
goes on I says, you dont hear the talk that I hear and you
can just bet I shut them up too. I says my people owned
slaves here when you all were running little shirt tail country stores and farming land no nigger would look at on shares.
If they ever farmed it It’s a good thing the Lord did
something for this country; the folks that live on it never
have. Friday afternoon, and from right here I could see
three miles of land that hadn’t even been broken, and
every able bodied man in the county in town at that
show. I might have been a stranger starving to deaths
and there wasn’t a soul in sight to ask which way to town
even. And she trying to get me to take aspirin. I says
when I eat bread I’ll do it at the table. I says you always
talking about how much you give up for us when you
could buy ten new dresses a year on the money you
spend for those damn patent medicines. It’s not some- thmg to cure it I need it’s just an even break not to have
to have them but as long as I have to work ten hours a
THE 5OXJND AND THE FTJEY 257
day to support a kitchen full of niggers in the style
they re accustomed to and send them to the show with
every other nigger in the county, only he was late ah
ready. By the time he got there it would be over. After awhile he got up to the car and when I finally
got it through his head if two people in a ford had passed
him, he said yes. So I went on, and when I came to where
the wagon road turned off I could see the tire tracks. Ab
Hussell was in his lot, but I didn’t bother to ask him and
I hadn’t got out of sight of his bam hardly when I saw
the ford. They had tried to hide it. Done about as well at
it as she did at everything else she did. Like I say it’s not
that I object to so much; maybe she cant help that, it’s because she hasn’t even got enough consideration for her
own family to have any discretion. I’m afraid all the time
111 run into them right in the middle of the street or un- der a wagon on the square, like a couple of dogs.
I parked and got out. And now I’d have to go way
around and cross a plowed field, the only one I had seen
since I left town, with every step like somebody was
walking along behind me, hitting me on the head with a club. I kept thinking that when I got across the field at
least I’d have something level to walk on, that wouldn’t
jolt me every step, but when I got iato the woods it was
full of underbrush and I had to twist around through it, and then I came to a ditch full of briers. I went along it for awhile, but it got thicker and thicker, and all the time
Earl probably telephoning home about where I was and
getting Mother aU upset again.
When I finally got through I had had to wind around
so much that I had to stop and figure out just where the
car would be. I knew they wouldn’t be far from it, just
under the closest bush, so I turned and worked back to- ward the road. Then I couldn’t tell just how far I was, so
25B the SOtJI^D AND THE ETJEY
rd have to stop and listen, and then with my legs not us- ing so much blood, it all would go into my head like it would explode any minute, and the sun getting down
just to where it could shine straight into my eyes and my
ears ringing so I couldn’t hear anything. I went on, trying
to move quiet, then I heard a dog or something and
I knew that when he scented me he’d have to come hell- ing up, then it would be all off. I had gotten beggar lice and twigs and stuff all over me, inside my clothes and shoes and all, and then I happened
to look around and I had my hand right on
a bunch of poison oak. The only thing I couldn’t understand
was why it was just poison oak and not a snake or something. So I didn’t even bother to move it. I just stood
there until the dog went away. Then I went on.
I didn’t have any idea where the car was now. I couldn’t think about anything except my head, and I’d
just stand in one place and sort of wonder if I had really seen a ford even, and I didn’t even care much whether I had or not. Like I say, let her lay out all day and all night
with everything in town that wears pants, what do I care.
I dont owe anything to anybody that has no more
consideration for me, that wouldn’t be a damn bit above
planting that ford there and making me spend a whole
afternoon and Earl taking her back there and showing
her the books just because he’s too damn virtuous for this world. I says you’ll have one hell of a time in heaven,
without anybody’s business to meddle in only dont you
ever let me catch you at it I says, I close my eyes to it because
of your grandmother, but just you let me catch you
doing it one time on this place, where my mother lives. These damn little slick haired squirts, thinking they are
raising so much hell. I’ll show them something about heU
I says, and you too. Ill make him think that damn red

de is </interval><interval value=38 novelty=0.8069 residual=-0.0129 level=normal>the latch string to hell, if he thinks he can run the
woods with my niece. With the sun and all in my eyes and my blood going
so I kept thinking every time my head would go on and
burst and get it over with, with briers and things grabbing
at me, then I came onto the sand ditch where they
had been and I recognised the tree where the car was, and just ^s I got out of the ditch and started running I heard the car start. It went off fast, blowing the horn.
They kept on blowing it, like it was saying Yah. Yah.
Yaaahhhhhhhh, going out of sight. I got to the road just in time to see it go out of sight.
By the time I got up to where my car was, they were
clean out of sight, the horn still blowing. Well, I never thought anything about it except I was saying Run. Run
back to town. Run home and try to convince Mother
that I never saw you in that car. Try to make her beheve
that I dont know who he was. Try to make her believe
that I didn't miss ten feet of catching you in that ditch. Try to make her believe you were standing up, too.
It kept on saying Yahhhhh, Yahhhhh, Yaaahhhhhhhhh,
getting fainter and fainter. Then it quit, and I could hear
a cow lowing up at Russell's bam. And still I uever
thought. I went up to the door and opened it and raised
my foot. I kind of thought then that the car was leaning a little more than the slant of the road would be, but I never found it out until I got in and started off. Well, I just sat there. It was getting on toward sun- down, and town was about five miles. They never even had guts enough to puncture it, to jab a hole in it. They
just let the air out. I just stood there for a while, thinking
about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them
had time to lift a tire onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts. It was kind of funny because even she
Z 60 THE SOUND AND THE EUEY
couldn t have seen far enough ahead to take the pump
out on purpose, unless she thought about it while he was
letting out the air maybe. But what it probably was, was
somebody took it out and gave it to Ben to play with
for a squirt gun because they’d take the whole car to pieces if he wanted it and Dilsey says, Aint nobody
teched yo car. What we want to fool with hit fer? and I says You re a nigger. You’re lucky, do you know it? I says
I’ll swap with you any day because it takes a white man
not to have anymore sense than to worry about what a
little slut of a girl does.
I walked up to Russell’s. He had a pump. That was
just an oversight on their part, I reckon. Only I still couldn’t believe she’d have had the nerve to. I kept
thinking that. I dont know why it is I cant seem to learn
that a woman’ll do anything. I kept thinking. Let’s forget
for awhile how I feel toward you and how you feel to- ward me: I just wouldn’t do you this way. I wouldn’t do
you this way no matter what you had done to me. Because
like I say blood is blood and you cant get around
it. It’s not playing a joke that any eight year old boy
could have thought of, it’s letting your own uncle be
laughed at by a man that would wear a red tie. They
come into town and call us all a bunch of hicks and think
it’s too small to hold them. Well he doesn’t know just
how right he is. And her too. If that’s the way she feels about it, she’d better keep right on going and a damn
good riddance.
I stopped and returned Russell’s pump and drove on
to town. I went to the drugstore and got a coca-cola and
then I went to the telegraph office. It had closed at
12.21, forty points down. Forty times five dollars; buy
something with that if you can, and she’ll say. I’ve got to have it I’ve just got to and I’ll say that’s too bad you’ll
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY l6l
have to try somebody else, I haven’t got any money; I’ve been too busy to make any.
I just looked at him.
TU tell you some news,” I says, "You’ll be astonished
to learn that I am interested in the cotton market," I says. "That never occurred to you, did it?’’ "I did my best to dehver it," he says. "I tried the store twice and called up your house, but they didn’t know
where you were,” he says, digging in the drawer.
"Deliver what?” I says. He handed me a telegram.
‘What time did this come?” I says. "About half past three," he says. "And now it’s ten minutes past five,” I says.
"I tried to deliver it,” he says. "I couldn’t find you.”
"That’s not my fault, is it?” I says. I opened it, just to see what kind of a lie they’d tell me this time. They must
be in one hell of a shape if they’ve got to come all the
way to Mississippi to steal ten dollars a month. Sell, it says. The market will be unstable, v^th a general downward
tendency. Do not be alarmed following government
report.
"How much would a message hke this cost?” I says. He
told me. "They paid it,” he says. "Then I owe them that much," I says. "I already knew
this. Send this collect,” I says, taking a blank. Buy, 1 wrote, Market just on point of blowing its head off. Oo
casional flurries for purpose of hooking a few more coun-' try suckers who haven’t got in to the telegraph office yet.
Do not be alarmed. "Send that collect,” I says. He looked at the message, then he looked at the clock,
"Market closed an hour ago,” he says. ‘Well,” I says, "That’s not my fault either. I didn’t in- vent it; I just bought a little of it while under the impres'
^62 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
sion that the telegraph company would keep me in- formed as to what it was doing.”
‘‘A report is posted whenever it comes in,” he says. 'Tes,” I says, ''And in Memphis they have it on a blackboard
every ten seconds,” I says. "I was within sixty- seven miles of there once this afternoon.” He looked at the message. "You want to send this?” he
says.
"I still haven’t changed my mind,” I says. I wrote the
other one out and counted the money. "And this one too,
if you’re sure you can spell b-u-y.”
I went back to the store. I could hear the band from
down the street. Prohibition’s a fine thing. Used to be
they’d come in Saturday with just one pair of shoes in the family and him wearing them, and they’d go down
to the express oflSice and get his package; now they all go
to the show barefooted, with the merchants in the door
like a row of tigers or something in a cage, watching
them pass. Earl says, "I hope it wasn’t anything serious.” "What?” I says. He looked at his watch. Then he went
to the door and looked at the courthouse clock. "You
ought to have a dollar watch,” I says. "It wont cost you
so much to believe it’s lying eadi time.”
"What?” he says. "Nothing,” I says. "Hope I haven’t inconvenienced
» you.
"We were not busy much,” he says. "They all went to the show. It’s all right.”
"If it’s not all right,” I says, ‘TTou know what you can do about it.” "I said it was all right,” he says. ‘T heard you,” I says. "And if it’s not all right, you
know what you can do about it.”
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 263
‘‘Do you want to quit?’’ he says.
“It’s not my business,” I says. “My wishes dont matter. But dont get the idea that you are protecting me by
keeping me.”
“You’d be a good business man if you’d let yourself,
Jason,” he says. “At least I can tend to my own business and let other
peoples’ alone,” I says.
“I dont know why you are trying to make me fire you,”
he says. “You know you could quit anytime and there
wouldn’t be any hard feelings between us.” “Maybe that’s why I dont quit,” I says. “As long as ] tend to my job, that’s what you are paying me for.” I went on to the back and got a drink of water and went on out to the back door. Job had the cultivators all set up at last. It was quiet there, and pretty soon my head
got a little easier. I could hear them singing now, and
Qien the band played again. Well, let them get every
quarter and dime in the county; it was no skin off my
back. I’ve done what I could; a man that can live as long
as I have and not know when to quit is a fool. Especially
as it’s no business of mine. If it was my own daughter
now it would be different, because she wouldn’t have
time to; she’d have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers, because how could I have the face to bring anybody there. I’ve too much respect for anybody to do that. I’m a man, I can stand it, it’s my
own flesh and blood and I’d like to see the colour of the
man’s eyes that would speak disrespectful of any woman
that was my friend it’s these damn good women that do
it I’d Hke to see the good, church-going woman that’s half as square as Lorraine, whore or no whore. Like I say if I was to get married you’d go up like a balloon and
you know it and she says I want you to be happy to have
264 the sound and the fuey
a family of your own not to slave your life away for us. But I’ll be gone soon and then you can take a wife but
you’ll never find a woman who is worthy of you and I says yes I could. You’d get right up out of your grave
you know you would. I says no thank you I have all the
women I can take care of now if I married a wife she’d
probably turn out to be a hophead or something. That’s
all we lack in this family, I says. The sun was down beyond the Methodist church now,
and the pigeons were flying back and forth around the
steeple, and when the band stopped I could hear them
cooing. It hadn’t been four months since Christmas, and
yet they were almost as thick as ever. I reckon Parson
Walthall was getting a belly full of them now. You’d
have thought we were shooting people, with him making
speeches and even holding onto a man’s gun when they came over. Talking about peace on earth good will to-^ ward all and not a sparrow can fall to earth. But what
does he care how thick they get, he hasn’t got anything
to do; what does he care what time it is. He pays no
taxes, he doesn’t have to see his money going every year
to have the courthouse clock cleaned to where it’ll run. They had to pay a man forty-five dollars to clean it. I counted over a hundred half-hatched pigeons on the
ground. You’d think they’d have sense enough to leave
town. It’s a good thing I dont have any more ties than a
</interval><interval value=39 novelty=0.7891 residual=-0.0298 level=normal>pigeon, I’ll say that. The band was playing again, a loud fast tune, like they were breaking up, I reckon they’d be satisfied now. Maybe they’d have enough music to entertain them while
they drove fourteen or fifteen miles home and unharnessed
in the dark and fed the stock and milked. AH
tliey d have to do would be to whistle the music and tell
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 265
the jokes to the live stock in the barn, and then they
could count up how much they’d made by not taking
the stock to the show too. They could figure that if a man had five children and seven mules, he cleared a
quarter by taking his family to the show. Just like that. Earl came back with a couple of packages.
“Here’s some more stuff going out,” he says. “Where’s
Uncle Job?”
“Gone to the show, I imagine,” I says. “Unless you
watched him.”
“He doesn’t slip off,” he says. “I can depend on him.’' “Meaning me by that,” I says. He went to the door and looked out, listening. “That’s a good band,” he says. “It’s about time they were breaking up, I’d say.”
“Unless they’re going to spend the night there,” I says. The swallows had begun, and I could hear the sparrows
beginning to swarm in the trees in the courthouse yard.
Every once in a while a bunch of them would come
swirling around in sight above the roof, then go away.
They are as big a nuisance as the pigeons, to my notion. You cant even sit in the courthouse yard for them. First thing you know, bing. Right on your hat. But it would
take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a
shot. If they’d just put a httle poison out there in the
square, they’d get rid of them in a day, because if a merchant
cant keep his stock from running around the
square, he’d better try to deal in something besides
chickens, something that dont eat, like plows or onions. And if a man dont keep his dogs up, he either dont want
it or he hasn’t any business with one. Like I say if all the
businesses in a town are run like country businesses,
you’re going to have a country town.
^66 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
"It wont do you any good if they have broke up ” I
says. ''Theyll have to hitch up and take out to get home
by midnight as it is.” ‘Well/’ he says, "They enjoy it. Let them spend a little money on a show now and then. A hill farmer works
pretty hard and gets mighty little for it.” "There’s no law making them farm in the hills ” I says, "Or anywhere else.” ‘Where would you and me be, if it wasn t for the farmers?”
he says. ‘Td be home right now,” I says, "Lying down, wuth an
ice pack on my head.”
"You have these headaches too often,” he says. "Why
dont you have your teeth examined good? Did he go
over ihem all this morning?”
"Did who?” I says. "You said you went to the dentist this morning.”
"Do you object to my having the headache on your
time?” I says. "Is that it?” They were crossing the alley
now, coming up from the show.
"There they come,” he says. "I reckon I better get up
front.” He went on. It’s a curious thing how no matter
what’s wrong with you, a man’ll tell you to have your
teeth examined and a woman’ll tell you to get married.
It always takes a man that never made much at any
thing to tell you how to run your business, though. Like
these college professors without a whole pair of socks to
their name, telling you how to make a million in ten
years, and a woman that couldn’t even get a husband can
always tell you how to raise a family.
Old man Job came up with the wagon. After a while
he got through wrapping the lines around the whip
socket. "Well,” I says, "Was it a good show?”
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 267
“I aint been yit/' he says. "But I Idn be arrested in dat
tent tonight, dough.”
"Like hell you haven't,” I says, "YouVe been away from
here since three oclock. Mr Earl was just back here look- ing for you.”
"I been tendin to my business ” he says. "Mr Earl
knows whar I been.”
'Tou may can fool him,” I says. '1 wont tell on you.”
"Den he's do onliest man here I'd try to fool,” he says. "Whut I want to waste my time foolin a man whut I dont
keer whether I sees him Sat'dy night er not? I wont try to
fool you,” he says. "You too smart fer me. Yes, suh,” he
says, looking busy as hell, putting five or six little packages
into the wagon, ‘'"You's too smart fer me. Aint a man
in dis town kin keep up wid you fer smartness. You fools a man whut so smart he cant even keep up wid hisself,”
he says, getting in the wagon and unwrapping the reins. 'Who's that?” I says. "Dat's Mr Jason Compson,” he says. "Git up dar, Dan!”
One of the wheels was just about to come off. I watched to see if he'd get out of the alley before it did. Just turn any vehicle over to a nigger, though. I says
that old rattletrap's just an eyesore, yet you'll keep it standing there in the carriage house a hundred years just so that boy can ride to the cemetery once a week. I says
he's not the first fellow that’ll have to do things he doesn't want to. I'd make him ride in that car like a civilised man
or stay at home. What does he know about where he goes
or what he goes in, and us keeping a carriage and a horse
so he can take a ride on Sunday afternoon. A lot Job cared whether the wheel came off or not, long
as he wouldn't have too far to walk back. Like I say the
only place for them is in the field, where they'd have to work from sunup to sundown. They cant stand prosper*

tty or an easy job. Let one stay around white people for a while and he s not worth killing. They get so they can
outguess you about work before your very eyes, like Roskus
the only mistake he ever made was he got careless one day and died. Shirking and stealing and giving you a
little more lip and a little more Hp until some day you
have to lay them out with a scantling or something. Well,
ifs Earl’s business. But I’d hate to have my business advertised
over this town by an old doddering nigger and
a wagon that you thought every time it turned a corner
it would come all to pieces.
The sun was all high up in the air now, and inside it was beginning to get dark* I went up front. The square was empty. Earl was back closing the safe, and then the
clock begun to strike. '"You lock the back door,” he says. I went back and
locked it and came back. 'T suppose you’re going to the
show tonight,” he says. "T gave you those passes yesterday,
didn’t I?” “Yes,” I said. “You want them back?”
“No, no,” he says, “I just forgot whether I gave them to you or not. No sense in wasting them.”
He locked the door and said Goodnight and went on. The sparrows were still rattling away in the trees, but the
square was empty except for a few cars. There was a ford
in front of the drugstore, but I didn’t even look at it. I know when I’ve had enough of anything. I dont mind
trying to help her, but I know when I’ve had enough. I guess I could teach Luster to drive it, then they could
chase her all day long if they wanted to, and I could stay
home and play with Ben.
I went in and got a couple of cigars. Then I thought
I’d have another headache shot for luck, and I stood and
talked with them awhile.
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 269
‘Well ” Mac says, '1 reckon you ve got your money oh
the Yankees this year/"
‘What for?” I says. “The Pennant/’ he says. “Not anything in the League
can beat them.”
“Like hell there’s not,” I says. “They’re shot,” I says. “You think a team can be that lucky forever?”
“I dont call it luck,” Mac says. “I wouldn’t bet on any team that fellow Ruth played
on,” I says. “Even if I knew it was going to win.”
“Yes?” Mac says.
“I can name you a dozen men in either League who re more valuable than he is,” I says. ‘What have you got against Ruth?” Mac says. “Nothing,” I says. “I haven’t got any thing against him.
I dont even like to look at his picture.” I went on out. The lights were coming on, and people going along the
streets toward home. Sometimes the sparrows never got
still until full dark. The night they turned on the new
lights around the courthouse it waked them up and
they were flying around and blundering into the lights aU
night long. They kept it up two or three nights, then one morning they were aU gone. Then after about two
months they aU came back again.
I drove on home. There were no lights in the house yet,
but they’d all be looking out the windows, and Dilsey
jawing away in the kitchen like it was her own food
she was having to keep hot until I got there. You’d think
to hear her that there wasn’t but one supper in the world,
and that was the one she had to keep back a few minutes
on my account. Well at least I could come home one
time without finding Ben and that nigger hanging on
the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage. Just
let it come toward sundown and he’d head for the gate
ZJO THE SOUND AND THE EURY
tike a cow for the bam, hanging onto it and bobbing his head and sort of moaning to himself. That’s a hog for punishment for you. If what had happened to him for
fooling with open gates had happened to me, I never would want to see another one. I often wondered what
he’d be thinking about, down there at the gate, watching
the girls going home from school, tiying to want something
he couldn’t even remember he didn’t and couldn’t want any longer. And what he’d think when they’d be
undressing him and he’d happen to take a look at himself
and begin to cry like he’d do. But like I say they never
did enough of that. I says I know what you need, you
need what they did to Ben then you’d behave. And if you dont know what that was I says, ask Dilsey to teP
you.There was a light in Mother’s room. I put the car up
and went on into the kitchen. Luster and Ben were there. ‘Where’s Dilsey?” I says. ‘Tutting supper on?”
“She upstairs wid Miss Cahline,” Luster says. “Dey

Mammy up there keepin um fom fightin. Is dat show

“Yes,” I says.
“I thought I heard de band,” he says. ‘Wish I could

“Maybe I went to the show,” I says. “Is supper ready?”
“Wish I could go,” Luster said. “I could ef I jes had a

“You aint got no business at no show,” Dilsey says. “You go on in de house and set down,” she says. “Dont

""En ef you had wings you could fly to heaven/’ Dilsey
says. ""I dont want to hear another word about dat show.”
""That reminds me,” I says, ""I’ve got a couple of ticket? they gave me.” I took them out of my coat, ""You fixin to use um?” Luster says. ""Not me,” I says. ""I wouldn’t go to it for ten dollars.”’ ‘"Gimme one of um, Mr Jason,” he says.
""I’ll sell you one,” I says. “How about it?”
""I aint got no money,” he says. “That’s too bad,” I says. I made to go out. “Gimme one of um, Mr Jason,” he says. “You aint gvdne need um bofe.” “Hush yo mouf,” Dilsey says, “Dont you know he ainf gwine give nothing away?”
""How much you want fer hit?” he says. “Five cents,” I says. “I aint got dat much,” he says. “How much you got?” I says. “I aint got nothing,” he says. “All right,” I says. I went on.

‘‘Mr Jason,” he says. “Whyn't you hush up?” Dilsey says. “He jes teasin you. He fixin to use dem tickets hisself. Go on, Jason, and
let him lone.”
“I dont want them,” I says. I came back to the stove.
“I came in here to burn them up. But if you want to buy one for a nickel?” I says, looking at him and opening
the stove lid. “I aint got dat much,” he says. “All right,” I says. I dropped one of them in the stove. “You, Jason,” Dilsey says, “Aint you shamed?”
“Mr Jason,” he says, “Please, suh. Ill fix dem tires evry
day fer a monP.”
“I need the cash,” I says. “You can have it for a nickel.” “Hush, Luster,” Dilsey says. She jerked him back. “Go
on,” she says, ''Drop hit in. Go on. Git hit over with.”
“You can have it for a nickel,” I says. “Go on,” Dilsey says. “He aint got no nickel. Go on. Drop hit in.” “All right,” I says. I dropped it in and Dilsey shut the
stove. “A big growed man like you,” she says. “Git on outen
my kitchen. Hush,” she says to Luster. “Dont you git
Benjy started. Ill git you a quarter from Frony tonight
and you kin go tomorrow night. Hush up, now.”
I wcac on into the living room. I couldn t hear anything
from upstairs. I opened the paper. After awhile
Ben and Luster came in. Ben went to the dark place on
the wall where the mirror used to be, rubbing his hands
on it ana slobbering and moaning. Luster begun punching
at the fire. “What’re you doing?” I says. “We dont need any fire to- night.”
THE SOUND AND THE EUUY 273
“I trying to keep him quiet/' he says. "‘Hit always cold
Easter/' he says. ''Only this is not Easter/' I says. "Let it alone." He put the poker back and got the cushion out of Mother's chair and gave it to Ben, and he hunkered down
in front of tire fireplace and got quiet.
I read the paper. There hadn’t been a sound from upstairs
when Dilsey came in and sent Ben and Luster on to the kitchen and said supper was ready.
"All right," I says. She went out. I sat there, reading the
paper. After a while I heard Dilsey looking in at the door. "Whyn t you come on and eat?” she says. "I'm waiting for supper,” I says. "Hit's on the table,” she says. "I done told you."
"Is it?” I says. "Excuse me. I didn't hear anybody come down.”
"They aint comin/' she says. "You come on and eat, so
I can take something up to them."
"Are they sick?” I says. "What did the doctor say it was? Not Smallpox, I hope."
"Come on here, Jason,” she says, "So I kin git done."
"All right,” I says, raising the paper again. "I'm waiting
for supper now.”
I could feel her watching me at the door. I read the paper.
"Whut you want to ask like this fer?” she says. "When
you knows how much bother I has anyway.”
"If Mother is any sicker than she was when she came down to dinner, all right,” I says. "But as long as I am
buying food for people younger than I am, they'll have to come down to the table to eat it. Let me know when
supper's ready," I says, reading the paper again. I heard
her climbing tihe stairs, dragging her feet and grunting
and groaning Hke they were straight up and three feet

Apart. I heard her at Mother s door, then I heard her call- tng Quentin, like the door was locked, then she went back
to Mother's room and then Mother went and talked to Quentin. Then they came down stairs. I read the paper.
Dilsey came back to the door. ''Come on,” she says, “fo you kin think up some mo devilment. You just tryin yoself
tonight.”
I went to the diningroom. Quentin was sitting with her
head bent. She had painted her face again. Her nose
looked like a porcelain insulator. 'Tm glad you feel well enough to come down,” I says
to Mother.
"It’s little enough I can do for you, to come to the
table,” she says. "No matter how I feel. I reahse that
when a man works all day he likes to be surrounded by
his family at the supper table. I want to please you. I only wish you and Quentin got along better. It would be
easier for me.”
"We get along all right,” I says. "I dont mind her staying
locked up in her room all day if she wants to. But I cant have all this whoop-de-do and sulking at mealtimes.
I know that’s a lot to ask her, but I’m that way in my own
house. Your house, I meant to say.”
"It’s yours,” Mother says, "You are the head of it now.”
Quentin hadn’t looked up. I helped the plates and she
begun to eat, "Did you get a good piece of meat?” I says. "If you
didn’t. I’ll try to find you a better one.” She didn’t say anything.
'1 say, did you get a good piece of meat?” I says, "What?” she says. "Yes. It’s all right.”
"Will you have some more rice?” I says. "No,” she says. "Better let me give you some more,” I says.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 275
'1 dont want any more/' she says. "Not at all/' I says, ‘Ton re welcome."
"Is your headache gone?” Mother says. "Headache?” I says.
"I was afraid you were developing one/' she says. ‘When you came in this afternoon.” "Oh/' I says. “No, it didn't show up. We stayed so busy
this afternoon I forgot about it.” 'Was that why you were late?” Mother says. I could
see Quentin listening. I looked at her. Her knife and fork were still going, but I caught her looking at me, then she
looked at her plate again. I says, "No. I loaned my car to a fellow about three o'clock and I had to wait until he got back with it.” I ate for a
while. 'Who was it?” Mother says.
"It was one of those show men/' I says. "It seems his
sister’s husband was out riding with some town woman,
and he was chasing them.”
Quentin sat perfectly still, chewing.
'Tou ought not to lend your car to people like that”
Mother says. "You are too generous with it. That's why I never call on you for it if I can help it.” "I was beginning to think that myself, for awhile,” I
says. "But he got back, all right. He says he found what
he was looking for.” "Who was Ae woman?” Mother says. 'TU tell you later,” I says. "I dont hke to talk about
such things before Quentin.”
Quentin had quit eating. Every once in a while she'd take a drink of water, then she'd sit there crumbling a
biscuit up, her face bent over her plate. "Yes.” Mother says, "I suppose women who stay shut
up like I do have no idea what goes on in this town.”
%7^ THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
'Tes,” I says, ‘'They dont/'
“My life has been so different from that,” Mother says, ’‘Thank God I dont know about such wickedness. I dont
even want to know about it. Tm not like most people.”
I didn t say any more. Quentin sat there, crumbling the
biscuit until I quit eating, then she says, “Can I go now?” without looking at anybody.
“What?” I says. “Sure, you can go. Were you waiting on us?”
She looked at me. She had crumbled all the biscuit,
but her hands still went on like they were crumbling it yet and her eyes looked like they were cornered or something
and then she started biting her mouth like it ought
to have poisoned her, with all that red lead. “Grandmother,” she says, “Grandmother—
”
“Did you want something else to eat?” I says. “Why does he treat me like tliis. Grandmother?” she
says. “I never hurt him.”
“I want you all to get along with one another,” Mother
says, “You are aU that s left now, and I do want you all to get along better.” “Ifs his fault,” she says, “He wont let me alone, and I have to. If he doesnt want me here, why wont he let me go back to

“Thafs enough,” I says, “Not another word.”
“Then why wont he let me alone?” she says. “He—^he just

“He is the nearest thing to a father youVe ever had,”
Mother says. “Ifs his bread you and I eat. Ifs only right
that he should expect obedience from you.”
“Ifs his fault,” she says. She jumped up. “He makes me
do it. If he would just— she looked at us, her eyes cor- nered, kind of jerking her arms against her sides.
“If I would just what?” I says.
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 277
'Whatever I do, it's your fault," she says. "If Im bad,
it's because I had to be. You made me. I wish I was dead.
I wish we were all dead." Then she ran. We heard her run up the stairs. Then a door slammed.
"That's the first sensible thing she ever said," I says. "She didn’t go to school today," Mother says. "How do you know?" I says. 'Were you down town?"
"I just know," she says. "I wish you could be k</interval><interval value=41 novelty=0.7524 residual=-0.0647 level=low>inder to hen"
"If I did that I’d have to arrange to see her more than once a day," I says. "You’ll have to make her come to the
table every meal. Then I could give her an extra piece of meat every time."
“There are little things you could do," she says. "Like not paying any attention when you ask me to see
that she goes to school?" I says. "She didn’t go to school today," she says. "I just know
she didn’t. She says she went for a car ride with one of the boys this afternoon and you followed her." "How could I," I says, "When somebody had my car
all afternoon? Whether or not she was in school today is already past," I says, "If you’ve got to worry about it, worry about next Monday."
"I wanted you and she to get along with one another,"
she says. "But she has inherited all of the headstrong
traits. Quentin’s too. I thought at the time, with the herit- age she would already have, to give her that name, too. Sometimes I think she is the judgment of Caddy and
Quentin upon me."
"Good Lord," I says, "You’ve got s fine mind. No
wonder you kept yourself sick all the time."
"What?" she says. "I dont understand."
"I hope not," I says. "A good woman misses a lot she’s better off without knowing."
2/« THE SOUND AND THE EUKY
‘TThey were both that way/’ she says, “They would
make interest with your father against me when I tried
to correct them. He was always saying they didn’t need
controlling, that they already knew what cleanliness and
honesty were, which was all that anyone could hope to be taught. And now I hope he’s satisfied.” “You’ve got Ben to depend on,” I says, “Cheer up.”
“They deliberately shut me out of their lives,” she
5ays, “It was always her and Quentin. They were always
conspiring against me. Against you too, though you
were too young to realise it. They always looked on you
and me as outsiders, like they did your Uncle Maury. I always told your father that they were allowed too much
freedom, to be together too much. When Quentin started to school we had to let her go the next year, so she could
be with him. She couldn’t bear for any of you to do anything
she couldn’t. It was vanity in her, vanity and false pride. And then when her troubles began I knew that Quentin would feel that he had to do something just as bad. But I didn’t believe that he would have been so self- ish as to—I didn’t dream that he
—
“Maybe he knew it was going to be a girl,” I says, “And that one more of them would be more than he
could stand.” “He could have controlled her,” she says. “He seemed
to be the only person she had any consideration for. But
that is a part of the judgment too, I suppose.”
“Yes,” I says, ^Too bad it wasn’t me instead of him.
You’d be a lot better oflF.” ‘You say things like that to hurt me,” she says, “I deserve
it though. When they began to sell the land to send
Quentin to Harvard I told your father that he must make
an equal provision for you. Then when Herbert offered
to take you into the bank I said, Jason is provided for

now, and when all the expense began to pile up and I was forced to sell our furniture and the rest of the pasture,
1 wrote her at once because I said she will reahse
that she and Quentin have had their share and part of Jason s too and that it depends on her now to compensate
him. I said she will do that out of respect for her father.
I believed that, then. But Im just a poor old woman; 1 was raised to beheve that people would deny themselves
for their own flesh and blood. Its my fault. You were
right to reproach me.”
"Do you think I need any man s help to stand on my
feet?” I says, ‘Xet alone a woman that cant name the father of her own child.” "Jason,” she says. "AU right,” I says. "I didn't mean that. Of course not.” If I believed that were possible, after aU my suffering.'
"Of course it s not,” I says. "I didn't mean it.” "I hope that at least is spared me,” she says. "Sure it is,” I says, "She's too much hke both of them
to doubt that.”
"I couldn't bear that,” she says. "Then quit thinking about it,” I says. "Has she been
worrying you any more about getting out at night?”
"No. I made her realise that it was for her own good
and that she'd thank me for it some day. She takes her
books with her and studies after I lock the door. I see the light on as late as eleven oclock some nights.”
"How do you know she's studying?” I says.
"I don't know what else she'd do in there alone,” she
says. "She never did read any.”
"No,” I says, "You wouldn't know. And you can thank
your stars for that,” I says. Only what would be the use
in saying it aloud. It would just have her crying on me
again.
28 o the SOTJISrD AND THE FUEY
I heard her go up stairs. Then she called Quentin and
Quentin says What? through the door. ‘‘Goodnight”
Mother says. Then I heard the key in the lock, and
Mother went back to her room. When I finished my cigar and went up, the hght was
, still on. I could see the empty keyhole, but I couldn t hear a sound. She studied quiet. Maybe she learned that
in school. I told Mother goodnight and went on to my
room and got the box out and counted it again. I could
hear the Great American Gelding snoring away like a planing mill. I read somewhere they’d fix men that way
to give them womens voices. But maybe he didn't know
what they’d done to him. I dont reckon he even knew
what he had been trying to do, or why Mr Burgess
knocked him out with the fence picket. And if they’d
just sent him on to Jackson while he was under the ether,
he’d never have known the difference. But that would
have been too simple for a Compson to think of. Not
half complex enough. Having to wait to do it at all until he broke out and tried to run a little girl down on
the street with her own father looking at him. Well, like I say they never started soon enough with their cutting,
and they quit too quick. I know at least two more that needed something like that, and one of them not over a
mile away, either. But then I dont reckon even that would do any good. Like I say once a bitch always a
bitch. And just let me have twenty-four hours without
any damn New York jew to advise me what it’s going to do. I dont want to make a killing; save that to suck in the smart gamblers with. I just want an even chance to get my money back. And once I’ve done that they can
bring all Beale Street and all bedlam in here and two of them can sleep in my bed and another one can have my
place at the table too.

T
he day DAWlSTED BLEAK AISTD CHILL. A MOVING WALL
of grey light out of the northeast which, instead oi dissolving into moisture, seemed to disintegrate into minute
and venomous particles, like dust that, when Dilsey
opened the door of the cabin and emerged, needled lat- erally into her flesh, precipitating not so much a moistoe
as a substance partaking of the quality of thin, not quite
congealed oil. She wore a stiff black straw hat perched
upon her turban, and a maroon velvet cape with a bor- der of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk, and she stood in the door for awhile with her
myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather, and one gaunt hand flac-soled as the belly of a fish, then she
moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her
gown.
The gown fell gauntly from her shoulders, across her
fallen breasts, then tightened upon her paunch and fell again, ballooning a little above the nether garments
which she would remove layer by layer as the spring ac comphshed and the warm days, in colour regal and mori-^ 281
5i 82 the sound and the fuey
bund. She had been a big woman once but now her
skeleton rose, draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened
again upon a paunch almost dropsical, as though
muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which
the days or the years had consumed until only the in- domitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark
above the somnolent and impervious guts, and
above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh, lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and
of a child's astonished disappointment, until she turned
and entered the house again and closed the door.
The earth immediately about the door was bare. It had
a patina, as though from the soles of bare feet in generations,
like old silver or the walls of Mexican houses which
have been plastered by hand. Beside the house, shading
it in summer, stood three mulberry trees, the fledged
leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms
of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air, A pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere, whirled up on
the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged
in the mulberries, where they swung in raucous tilt and
recover, screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh
cries oi^ward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in
turn. Then three more joined them and they swung and
tilted in the wrxmg branches for a time, screaming. The
door of the cabin opened and Dilsey emerged once more,
this time in a man s felt hat and an army overcoat, beneath
the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress
fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she
crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen
door. A moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella
now, which she slanted ahead into the wind, and
THE SOUISTD AHD THE FUEY
crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down,
still open* Immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while, lookhig about her. Then she
closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm, against her breast, and picked up the
umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps
and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived
to close the umbrella, which she propped in the corner just within the door. She dumped the wood into the box behind the stove. Then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall
and put it on and built a f</interval><interval value=42 novelty=0.8174 residual=0.0012 level=normal>ire in the stove. While she was
doing so, rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids, Mrs Compson began to call her from the head of the
stairs. She wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin, hold-' ing it close under her chin. In the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head oi the back stairway, calling “Dilsey ’ at steady and inflec* tionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended
into complete darkness, then opened again where a grey
window fell across it. 'TDilsey,"^ she called, without inflec- tion or emphasis or haste, as though she were not listen ing for a reply at all. ^"Dilsey.""
Dilsey answered and ceased clattering the stove, but
before she could cross the kitchen Mrs Compson called her again, and before she crossed the diningroom and
brought her head into relief against the grey splash of the window, still again.
"‘All right,"' Dilsey said, “All right, here I is. Ill fill hit soon ez I git some hot water." She gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs, wholly blotting the grey light.
“Put hit down dar en g'awn back to bed."
“I couldn't understand what was the matter," Mrs
284 THE SOUND AND THE EHEY
Compson said. "IVe been lying awake for an hour at
least, without hearing a sound from the kitchen.”
"'You put hit down and g'awn back to bed,” Dilsey
said. She toiled painfully up the steps, shapeless, breathing
heavily. “I’ll have de &e gwine in a minute, en de
water hot in two mo.”
Tve been lying there for an hoinr, at least,” Mrs Compson
said. "1 thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire.” Dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water
bottle. Til fix hit in a minute,” she said. “Luster overslep
dis mawnin, up half de night at dat show. I gwine build
de fire myself. Go on now, so you wont wake de others
twell I ready.”
"If you permit Luster to do things that Interfere with
his work, you’ll have to suffer for it yourself,” Mrs Compson
said. “J^sort wont like this if he hears about it. You
know he wont.”
“Twusn t none of Jasons money he went on,” Dilsey
said. “Dat’s one thing sho.” She went on dovm the stairs. Mrs Compson returned to her room. As she got into bed
again she could hear Dilsey yet descending the stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would
have become maddening had it not presently ceased beyond
the flapping diminishment of the pantry door. She entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began
to prepare breakfast. In the midst of this she ceased
and went to the mndow and looked out toward her
cabin, then she went to the door and opened it and
shouted into the driving weather.
“Luster!” she shouted, standing to listen, tilting her face
from the wind, “You, Luster?” She listened, then as she
prepared to shout again Luster appeared around the
corner of the kitchen.
THE SOUND AND THE EUEY 285
‘‘Ma'am?''' he said innocently, so innocently that Dilsey
looked down at him, for a moment motionless with something
more than mere surprise.
“Whar you at?" she said. “Nowhere," he said. “Jes in de cellar." “Whut you doin in de cellar?” she said. “Dont stand
dar in de rain, fool," she said. “Aint doin nothin,” he said. He came up the steps.
“Dont you dare come in dis do widout a armful of wood,” she said. “Here I done had to tote yo wood en
build yo fire bofe. Didn't I tole you not to leave dis place last night befo dat woodbox wus full to de top?"
“I did,” Luster said, ‘1 filled hit." “Whar hit gone to, den?"
“I dont know'm. I aint teched hit." “Well, you git hit full up now,” she said. “And git on up den en see bout Benjy."
She shut the door. Luster went to the woodpile. The
five jaybirds whirled over the house, screaming, and
into the mulberries again. He watched them. He picked
up a rock and threw it. “Whoo,” he said, “Git on back
to hell, whar you belong at. 'Taint Monday yit."
He loaded himself mountainously with stove wood.
He could not see over it, and he staggered to the steps
and up them and blundered crashing against the door,
shedding billets. Then Dilsey came and opened the door
for him and he blundered across the kitchen. “You, Luster!”
she shouted, but he had aheady hurled the wood
into the box with a thunderous crash. “H'h!" he said. “Is you tryin to wake up de whole house?” Dilsey said- She hit him on the back of his head with the flat of hot
hand. “Go on up dar and git Benjy dressed, now.”
“Yessum," he said. He went toward the outer door. “Whar you gwine?" Dilsey said.
z86 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
“I thought I better go round de house en in by de
iront, so I wont wake up Miss Cahline en dem/'
""You go on up dem backstairs like I tole you en git
Benjy's clothes on him " Dilsey said. "Go on, now.”
"'Yessum,” Luster said. He returned and left by the
diningroom door. After awhile it ceased to flap. Dilsey
prepared to make biscuit. As she ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at
first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive,
mournful and plaintive, austere, as she ground a
faint, steady snowing of flour onto the breadboard. The
stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with murmurous
minors of the fire, and presently she was singing
louder, as if her voice too had been thawed out by the
growing warmth, and then Mrs Compson called her name again from within the house. Dilsey raised her face
as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceil- ing and saw the old woman in her quilted dressing gown
at the head of the stairs, calhng her name with machinelike
regularity.
"Oh, Lawd,” Dilsey said. She set the sifter down and
swept up the hem of her apron and wiped her hands
and caught up the bottle from the chair on which she
had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle which was now jetting faintly. "Jes a minute,”
she called, "De water jes dis minute got hot.”
It was not the bottle which Mrs Compson wanted
however, and clutching it by the neck like a dead hen
Dilsey went to the foot of the stairs and looked upward.
"Aint Luster up dar wid him?” she said. "Tiuster basn^'t been in the house. Tve been lying here
listening for him. I knew he would be late, but I did hope
he'd come in time to keep Benjamin from disturbing Ja-

^ngr
‘1 dont see how you expect anybody to sleep, wid you
standin in de hall, hollm at folks fuin de crack of dawn,” Dilsey said. She began to mount the stairs, toiling
heavily. ‘1 sont dat boy up dar half hour ago.”
Mrs Compson watched her, holding the dressing gown
under her chin. ''What are you going to do?” she said. ''Gwine git Benjy dressed en bring him down to de
kitchen, whar he wont wake Jason en Quentin,” Dilsey
said. "Haven’t you started breakfast yet?”
"I’ll tend to dat too,” Dilsey said. "You better git back
in bed twell Luster make yo fire. Hit cold dis mawnin.”
"I know it,” Mrs Compson said. "My feet are like ice. They were so cold they waked me up.” She watched Dih
sey mount the stairs. It took her a long while. 'TTou know
how it frets Jason when breakfast is late,” Mrs Compson
said.
"I cant do but one thing at a time,” Dilsey said. "You
git on back to bed, £0 I has you on my hands dis mawnin
too.”
"If you’re going to drop everything to dress Benjamin,
I’d better come down and get breakfast. You know as well as I do how Jason acts when it’s late.” "En who gwine eat yo messin?” Dilsey said. "Tell me
dat. Go on now,” she said, toiling upward. Mrs Compson
stood watching her as she mounted, steadying herself against the wall with one hand, holding her skirts up
with the other. "Are you going to wake him up just to dress him?” she
said. Dilsey stopped. With her foot lifted to the next step
7.88 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
she stood there, her hand against the wall and the grey
splash of the window behind her, motionless and shapeless
she loomed.
‘'He aint awake den?” she said. “He wasn’t when I looked in,” Mrs Compson said. “But
it’s past his time. He never does sleep after half past
seven. You know he doesn’t.” Dilsey said nothing. She made no further move, but
though she could not see her save as a blobby shape
without depth, Mrs Compson knew that she had lowered
her face a little and that she stood now like a cow in the
rain, as she held the empty water bottle by its neck.
“You’re not the one who has to bear it,” Mrs Compson
said. “It’s not your responsibility. You can go away. You
dont have to bear the brunt of it day in and day out. You owe nothing to them, to Mr Compson’s memory. I know you have never had any tenderness for Jason,
You’ve never tried to conceal it.” Dilsey said nothing. She turned slowly and descended,
lowering her body from step to step, as a small child
does, her hand against the wall. ‘Tfou go on and let him
alone,” she said. “Dont go in dar no mo, now. I’ll send
Luster up soon as I find him. Let him alone, now\”
She returned to the kitchen. She looked into the stove,
dien she drew her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer door and looked up and
down the yard. The weather drove upon her flesh, harsh
and minute, but the scene was empty of all else that
moved. She descended the steps, gingerly, as if for si- lence, and went around the comer of the kitchen. As she
did so Luster emerged quickly and innocently from the
cellar door. Dilsey stopped. “Whut you up to?” she said.
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 289
'"Nothin,” Luster said, "Mr Jason say fer me to find out what dat water leak in de cellar fum.”
"En when wus hit he say fer you to do dat?” Dilsey
said, "last New Years day, wasnt hit?”
"1 thought I jes be lookin whiles dey sleep,” Luster
said. Dilsey went to the cellar door. He stood aside and
she peered down into the obscurity odorous of dank
earth and mould and rubber.
"Huh,” Dilsey said. She looked at Luster again. He met
her gaze blandly, innocent and open. "I dont know whut
you up to, but you aint got no business doin hit. You jea
tryin me too dis m</interval><interval value=43 novelty=0.8041 residual=-0.0112 level=normal>awnin cause de others is, aint you?
You git on up dar en see to Benjy, you hear?”
"Yessum,” Luster said. He went on toward the kitchen
steps, swiftly.
"Here,” Dilsey said, "You git me another armful of wood while I got you.”
"Yessum,” he said. He passed her on the steps and
went to the woodpile. When he blundered again at the
door a moment later, again invisible and blind within
and beyond his wooden avatar, Dilsey opened the dooi
and guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand.
"Jes thow hit at dat box again,” she said, "Jes thow
hit.”"I got to,” Luster said, panting, "I cant put hit down no
other way.”
"Den you stand dar en hold hit a while,” Dilsey said. She unloaded him a stick at a time. "Whut got into you
dis mawnin? Here I sont you fer wood en you aint nevei
brought mo n six sticks at a time to save yo life twell to* day. Whut you fixin to ax me kin you do now? Aint dat
show lef town yit?”
"Yessum. Hit done gone
”
2^0 THE SOUND AND THE FUKY
She put the last stick into the box. "‘Now you go on up
dar wid Benjy, hke I tole you befo/’ she said. ""And I dont
want nobody else yellin down dem stairs at me twell I rings de bel!. You hear me.’"" ‘"Yessum,” Luster said. He vanished through the swing
door. Dilsey put some more wood in the stove and re- turned to tihe bread board. Presently she began to sing
again.
The room grew warmer. Soon Dilsey's skin had taken on a rich, lustrous quality as compared with that as of a
faint dusting of wood ashes which both it and Luster’s had worn, as she moved about the kitchen, gathering
about her the raw materials of food, coordinating the
meal. On the wall above a cupboard, invisible save at
night, by lamp light and even then evincing an enigmatic
profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet clock
ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared
its throat, struck five times.
""Eight oclock,” Dilsey said. She ceased and tilted her
head upward, listening. But there was no sound save the
clock and the fire. She opened the oven and looked at the
pan of bread, then stooping she paused while someone
descended tlie stairs. She heard the feet cross the diningroom,
then the swing door opened and Luster entered,
followed by a big man who appeared to have been
shaped of some substance whose particles would not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported
it. His skin was dead looking and hairless; dropsical
too, he moved with a shambling gait like a trained
bear. His hair was pale and fine. It had been brushed
smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in daguerrotypes. His eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue
of cornflowers, his thick mouth hung open, drooling a
little.
TEE SOEND AND THE EURY 19t
'Is he cold?” Dilsey said. She wiped her hands on her
apron and touched his hand.
"Ef he aint, I is,” Luster said. "Always cold Easter. Aint never seen hit fail. Miss Cahllne say ef you aint got time
to fix her hot water bottle to never mind about hit.” "Oh, lawd,” Dilsey said. She drew a chair into the cor- ner between the woodbox and the stove. The man went
obediently and sat in it. "Look in de dinin room and see whar I laid dat bottle down ” Dilsey said. Luster fetched
the bottle from the diningroom and Dilsey filled it and
gave it to him. "Hurry up, now/* she said. "See ef Jason wake now. Tell em hit’s all ready.”
Luster went out. Ben sat beside the stove. He sat loosely, utterly motionless save for his head, which made
a continual bobbing sort of movement as he v^atched
Dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved about.
Luster returned.
"He up,” he said, "Miss Cahline say put hit on de
table.” He came to the stove and spread his hands palm
down above the firebox. "He up, too,” He said, "Gwine
hit wid bofe feet dis mawnin.”
"Whut’s de matter now?” Dilsey said. "Git away fum
dar. How kin I do anything wid you standin over de
stove?”
"I cold,” Luster said. ‘'You ought to thought about dat whiles you wus down
dar in dat cellar,” Dilsey said. "Whut de matter wid
Jason?”
"Sayin me en Benjy broke dat winder in his room.”
"Is dey one broke?” Dilsey said. "Dat’s whut he sayin,” Luster said. "Say I broke hit.” "How could you, when he keep hit locked all day en
night?”
"Say I broke hit chunkin rocks at hit,” Luster said.
l$z THE SOUND AND THE EUEY
“En did you?”
“Nome” Luster said. “Dont lie to me, boy,” Dilsey said. “I never done hit,” Luster said. “Ask Benjy ef I did. I aint stud'in dat winder.”
“Who could a broke hit, den?” Dilsey said. “He jes tryia
hisself, to wake Quentin up,” she said, taking the pan of
biscuits out of the stove. “Reckin so,” Luster said. “Dese is funny folks. Glad I aint none of em.”
“Aint none of who?” Dilsey said. “Lemme tell you
somethin, nigger boy, you got jes es much Compson devilment
in you es any of em. Is you right sho you never
broke dat window?”
“Whut I want to break hit fur?” "Whut you do any of you devilment fur?” Dilsey said. “Watch him now, so he cant burn his hand again twell I
git de table set.” She went to the diningroom, where they heard her
moving about, then she returned and set a plate at the
kitchen table and set food there. Ben watched her, slob- bering, making a faint, eager sound.
“All right, honey,” she said, “Here yo breakfast. Bring
his chair, Luster.” Luster moved the chair up and Ben
sat down, whimpering and slobbering. Dilsey tied a cloth
about his neck and wiped his mouth with the end of it. “And see kin you kep fum messin up his clothes one
time,” she said, handing Luster a spoon.
Ben ceased whimpering. He watched the spoon as it rose to his mouth. It was as if even eagerness were muscle-bound
in him too, and hunger itself inarticulate, not
knowing it is hunger. Luster fed him with skill and detachment.
Now and then his attention would return long
enough to enable him to feint the spoon and cause Ben
THE SOUND AND THE rURY ^93
to close his mouth upon the empty air, but it was apparent
that Luster s mind was elsewhere. His other hand
lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface
it moved tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an
inaudible tune out of the dead void, and once he even
forgot to tease Ben with the spoon while his fingers
teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved
arpeggio until Ben recalled him by whimpering again.
In the diningroom Dilsey moved back and forth. Pres- ently she rang a small clear bell, then in the kitchen Luster
heard Mrs Compson and Jason descending, and Ja- sons voice, and he rolled his eyes whitely with listening.
"Sure, I know they didn't break it," Jason said. "Sure,
I know that. Maybe the change of weather broke it." "I dont see how it could have," Mrs Compson said. 'TTour room stays locked all day long, just as you leave it when you go to town. None of us ever go in there except
Sunday, to clean it. I dont want you to think that I would
go where Tm not wanted, or that I would permit anyone
else to." "I never said you broke it, did I?" Jason said. "I dont want to go in your room," Mrs Compson said* "I respect anybody's private afiEairs. I wouldn't put my
foot over the threshold, even if I had a key."
"Yes,” Jason said, "I know your keys wont fit. ThaPs
why I had the lock changed. What I want to know is, how that window got broken."
‘TLuster say he didn't do hit," Dilsey said. "I knew that without asking him," Jason said. "Where's
Quentin?” he said. "Where she is evy Sunday mawnin," Dilsey said. ‘Whut got into you de last few days, anyhow?"
‘"Well, we're going to change all that," Jason said. "Go
up and tell her breakfast is ready."
2^4 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
‘"You leave her alone now’, Jason,"' Dilsey said. "She
gits up £er breakfast ev y week mavrain, en Cahline lets her stay in bed evy Sunday. You knows dat."
"I cant keep a kitchen full of niggers to wait on her
pleasure, much as I’d hke to,'" Jason said. "Go and tell her to come down to breakfast.” "Aint nobody have to wait on her,” Dilsey said. "I puts her brealcfast in de warmer en she

"Did you hear me?” Jason said. "I hears you,” Dilsey said. "All I been hearin, when you
in de house. Ef hit aint Quentin er yo maw, hit’s Luster en Benjy. Whut you let him go on dat way fer. Miss
Cahline?”
"You’d better do as he says,” Mrs Compson said, "He’s
head of the house now. It’s his right to require us to re- spect his wishes. I try to do it, and if I can, you can too.” "Taint no sense in him bein so bad tempered he got
to make Quentin git up jes to suit him,” Dilsey said. "Maybe you think she broke dat window.”
"She would, if she happened to think of it,” Jason said. ^TTou go and do what I told you.”
"En I wouldn’t blame her none ef she did,” Dilsey
said, going toward the stairs. "Wid you naggin at her aU
de blessed time yo in de house.”
"Hush, Dilsey,” Mrs Compson said, "It’s neither your
place nor mine to tell Jason what to do. Sometimes I think he is wrong, but I try to obey his wishes for you
alls’ sakes. If I’m strong enough to come to the table,
Quentin can too.” Dilsey went out. They heard her mounting the stairs. They heard her a long while on the stairs. "You’ve got a prize set of servants,” Jason said. He
helped his mother and himself to food. "Did you ever have one that was worth killing? You must have had
some before I was big enough to remember.”
THE SOUI^D AND THE EXJEY 295
T have to humour them/’ Mrs Compson said. “I have
to depend on them so completely. Its not as if I were
strong. I wish I were. I wish I could do all the house
work myself. I could at least take that much ofiF youi
shoulders.”
"And a fine pigsty we’d five in, too,” Jason said. "'Hurry
up, Dilsey,” he shouted.
"I know you blame me,” Mrs Compson said, "for let- ting them off to go to church today.”
"Go where?” Jason said. "Hasn’t that damn show left yet?”
"To church,” Mrs Compson said, "The darldes are having
a special Easter service. I promised Dilsey two weeks
ago that they could get off.” "Which means we’ll eat cold dinner,” Jason said, "oi none at all.” "I know it’s my fault,” Mrs Compson said. </interval><interval value=44 novelty=0.8217 residual=0.0073 level=normal>"I know you
blame me.”
"For what?” Jason said. "You never resurrected Christ,
did you?”
They heard Dilsey mount the final stair, then her slow
feet overhead.
"Quentin,” she said. When she called the first time Ja- son laid his knife and fork down and he and his mother
appeared to wait across the table from one another, in
identical attitudes; the one cold and shrewd, with close- thatched brown hair curled into two stubborn hooks, one on either side of his forehead like a bartender in caricature,
and hazel eyes with black-ringed irises like marbles,
the other cold and querulous, with perfectly white hair
and eyes pouched and baffled and so dark as to appear
to be all pupil or all iris. "Quentin,” Dilsey said, "Git up, honey. Dey waitin
breakfast on you.”
"I cant understand how that window got broken,” Mrs
Z$6 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
Compson said. "Are you sure it was done yesterday? It could have been like that a long time, with the warm
weather. The upper sash, behind the shade like that.” 'Tve told you for the last time that it happened yesterday,”
Jason said. "Dont you reckon I know the room I live in? Do you reckon I could have lived in it a week
with a hole in the window you could stick your hand—
”
his voice ceased, ebbed, left him staring at his mother
with eyes that for an instant were quite empty of anything.
It was as though his eyes were holding their breath,
while his mother looked at him, her face flaccid and querulous,
interminable, clairvoyant yet obtuse. As they sat so Dilsey said,
"Quentin. Dont play wid me, honey. Come on to
breakfast, honey. Dey waitin fer you.”
"I cant understand it,” Mrs Compson said, "Ifs just as
if somebody had tried to break into the house— Jason
sprang up. His chair crashed over backward. "What

Mrs Compson said, staring at him as he ran past her and
went jumpmg up the stairs, where he met Dilsey. His
face was now in shadow, and Dilsey said,
"She sullin. Yo ma aint unlocked— But Jason ran on
past her and along the corridor to a door. He didn't call. He grasped the knob and tried it, then he stood with the
knob in his hand and his head bent a htde, as if he were
listening to something much further away than the di- mensioned room beyond the door, and which he already
heard. His attitude was that of one who goes through
the motions of listening in order to deceive himself as to what he already hears. Behind him Mrs Compson
mounted the stairs, calling his name. Then she saw Dil- sey and she quit calling him and began to call Dilsey in- stead.
"I told you she amt imlocked dat do' yit,” Dilsey said
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 297
When she spoke he turned and ran toward her, but his voice was quiet, matter of fact. “'She carry the key with
her?” he said. “Has she got it now, I mean, or v^l she
have—
”
“Dilsey,” Mrs Compson said on the stairs. “Is which?” Dilsey said. “Whyn t you let
—
“The key,” Jason said, “To that room. Does she carry it with her all the time. Mother.” Then he saw Mrs Compson
and he went down the stairs and met her. “Give me
the key,” he said. He fell to pawing at the pockets of the
rusty black dressing sacque she wore. She resisted. “Jason,” she said, “Jason! Are you and Dilsey trying to put me to bed again?” she said, trying to fend him off, “Cant you even let me have Sunday in peace?”
“The key,” Jason said, pawing at hei, “Give it here.” He looked back at the door, as if he expected it to fly
open before he could get back to it with the key he did
not have.
“You, Dilsey!” Mrs Compson said, clutching her sacque
about her. “Give me the key, you old fool!” Jason cried suddenly.
From her pocket he tugged a huge bunch of rusted keys on an iron ring like a mediaeval jailer s and ran back up
the hall with the two women behind him.
“You, Jason!” Mrs Compson said. “He will never find the right one,” she said, "TTou know I never let anyone
take my keys, Dilsey,” she said. She began to wail. “Hush,” Dilsey said, “He aint gwine do nothin to her.
I aint gwine let him.”
“But on Sunday morning, in my own house,” Mrs
Compson said, “When IVe tried so hard to raise them
Christians. Let me find the right key, Jason,” she said. She put her hand on his arm. Then she began to struggle
with him, but he flung her aside with a motion of his el-
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
bow and looked around at ber for a moment, liis eyes
cold and harried, then he turned to the door again and
the unwieldy keys.
"Hush,"’ Dilsey said, ^"You, Jason!”
"Something terrible has happened,” Mrs Compson said,
wailing again, "I know it has. You, Jason,” she said, grasping
at him again. "He wont even let me find the key to a room in my own house!”
"Now, now,” Dilsey said, ‘Whut kin happen? I right
here. I aint gwine let him hurt her. Quentin,” she said,
raising her voice, "Dont you be skeered, honey, I’se right
here.” The door opened, swung inward. He stood in it for a moment, hiding the room, then he stepped aside. "Go in,”
he said in a thick, light voice. They went in. It was not a
giiTs room. It was not anybody’s room, and the faint scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects
and other evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminize
it but added to its anonymity, giving it that dead
and stereotyped transience of rooms in assignation
houses. The bed had not been disturbed. On the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap sflk a httle too pink;
from a half open bureau drawer dangled a single stocking.
The window was open. A pear tree grew there, close against the house. It was in bloom and the branches
scraped and rasped against the house and the myriad air, driving in the vundow, brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms.
"Dar now,” Dilsey said, "Didn’t I told you she all right?” "All right?” Mrs Compson said. Dilsey followed her
into the room and touched her. "You come on and lay down, now,” she said. ‘T find her
in ten minutes.”
THE SOUIN-D AND THE EtTRY 295? Mrs Compson shook her oflF. "Find the note,” she said. "Quentin left a note when he did it.” "All right,” Dilsey said, "I’ll find hit. You come on to yo
room, now.”
"I knew the minute they named her Quentin this would happen,” Mrs Compson said. She went to the bureau
and began to turn over the scattered objects there
—
scent bottles, a box of powder, a chewed pencil, a pair
of scissors with one broken blade lying upon a darned
scarf dusted with powder and stained with rouge. "Find
the note,” she said.
"I is,” Dilsey said. 'You come on, now. Me and Jason U
find hit. You come on to yo room.”
"Jason,” Mrs Compson said, "Where is he?” She went to the door. Dilsey followed her on down the hall, to an- other door. It was closed. "Jason,” she called through the
door. There was no answer. She tried the knob, then she
called him again. But there was still no answer, for he was hurling things backward out of the closet: garments,
shoes, a suitcase. Then he emerged carrying a sawn sec- tion of tongue-and-groove planking and laid it down and
entered the closet again and emerged with a metal box.
He set it on the bed and stood looking at the broken
lock while he dug a key ring from his pocket and
selected a key, and for a time longer he stood with the
selected key in his hand, looking at the broken lock, then
he put the keys back in his pocket and carefully tilted the contents of the box out upon the bed. Still carefully
he sorted the papers, taking them up one at a time and
shaking them. Then he upended the box and shook it too and slowly replaced the papers and stood again, looking
at the broken lock, with the box in his hands and his head bent. Outside the window he heard some jaybirds
swirl shrieking past, and away, their cries whipping away
300 THE SOUHD AND THE EUEY
along the wind, and an automobile passed somewhere
and died away also. His mother spoke his name again
beyond the door, but he didn’t move. He heard Dilsey
lead her away up the hall, and then a door closed. Then
he replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments
back into it and went down stairs to the telephone. While
he stood there with the receiver to liis ear, waiting, Dil- sey came down the stairs. She looked at him, without
stopping, and went on. The wire opened. 'This is Jason Compson,” he said,
his voice so harsh and thick that he had to repeat himself.
"Jason Compson,” he said, controlling his voice. "Have a car ready, with a deputy, if you cant go, in ten
minutes. Ill be there—^What?—Robbery. My house. I know who it—Robbery, I say. Have a car ready—^What?
Aren’t you a paid law enforcement—^Yes, I’ll be there in
five minutes. Have that car ready to leave at once. If you
dont, 111 report it to the governor.”
He clapped the receiver back and crossed the diningroom,
where the scarce-broken meal now lay cold on
die table, and entered the kitchen. Dilsey w’^as filling the
hot water bottle. Ben sat, tranquil and empty. Beside
liim Luster looked hke a fice dog, brightly watchful. He
was eating something. Jason went on across the kitchen.
"Aint you going to eat no breakfast?” Dilsey said. He
paid her no attention. "Go and eat yo breakfast, Jason.” He went on. The outer door banged behind him. Luster
rose and went to the window and looked out. "Whoo,” he said, "Whut happenin up dar? He been
beatin Miss Quentin?”
"You hush yo mouf,” Dilsey said. "You git Benjy
started now en I beat yo head off. You keep him quiet es you kin tweU I get back, now.” She screwed the cap on
the bottle and went out. They heard her go up the stairs,
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 30I
then they heard Jason pass the house in his car. Then
there was no sound in the kitchen save the simmering
mui-mur of the kettle and the clock. "You know whut I bet?” Luster said. "I bet he beat her.
I bet he knock her in de head en now he gone fer de
doctor. Dafs whut I bet.” The clock tick-tocked, solemn
and profound. It might have been the dry pulse of the
decaying house itself; after a while it whirred and cleared
its throat and struck six times. Ben looked up at it, then
he looked at the bullet-like silhouette of Lu</interval><interval value=45 novelty=0.7955 residual=-0.018 level=normal>ster s head in the window and he begim to bob his head again, drooling.
He whimpered.
"Hush up, loony,” Lusher said without turning. "Look
like we aint gwine git tc go to no church today.” But
Ben sat in the chair, his big soft hands dangling between
his knees, moaning faintly. Suddenly he wept, a slow bel- lowing sound, meaningless and sustained. "Hush,” Luster
said. He turned and lifted his hand. "You want me to whup you?” But Ben looked at him, bellowing slowly
with each expiration. Luster came and shook him. 'Tou
hush dis minute!” he shouted. "Here,” he said. He hauled
Ben out of tire chair and dragged the chair around facing
the stove and opened the door to the firebox and shoved
Ben into the chair. They looked like a tug nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock. Ben sat down again
facing the rosy door. He hushed. Then they heard the
clock again, and Dilsey slow on the stairs. When she en- tered he began to whimper again. Then he lifted his voice. "Whut you done to him?” Dilsey said. "Why cant you
let him lone dis mawnin, of all times?”
""I aint doin nothin to him,” Luster said. ""Mr Jason skeered him, dat's whut hit is. He aint kilt Miss Quentin,
is he?”
302 THE SOIJHE AND THE FXJBY
“Hush, Benjy/’ Dilsey said. He hushed. She went to the
window and looked out. “Is it quit rainin?” she said,
“Yessum,” Luster said. “Quit long time ago.”
“Den yall go out do s a while,” she said. “I jes got Miss
Cahline quiet now.”
“Is we gwine to church?” Luster said.
“I let you know bout dat when de time come. You
keep him away fum de house twell I calls you.”
“Kin we go to de pastuh?” Luster said. “All right. Only you keep him away fum de house. I done stood all I kin.” “Yessum,” Luster said. ‘Whar Mr Jason gone, mammy?”
“Dat’s some mo of yo business, aint it?” Dilsey said. She
began to clear the table. “Hush, Benjy. Luster gwine take
you out to play.”
“Whut he done to Miss Quentin, mammy?” Luster said. “Aint done nothin to her. You all git on outen here.”
“I bet she aint here,” Luster said. Dilsey looked at him. “How you know she aint here?”
“Me and Benjy seed her clamb out de window last night. Didn't us, Benjy?”
‘"You did?” Dilsey said, looking at him.
“We sees her doiii hit evy night,” Luster said, “Clamb
right down dat pear tree.” “Dont you lie to me, nigger boy,” Dilsey said.
“I aint lyin. Ask Benjy ef I is.” “Whyn t you say somethin about it, den?”
“'Twam't none o my business,” Luster said. “I aint
gwine git mixed up in white folks' business. Come on
here, Benjy, les go out do's.” They went out. Dilsey stood for awhile at the table,
then she went and cleared the breakfast things from the
diningroom and ate her breakfast and cleaned up the
kitchen. Then she removed her apron and hung it up
THE SOUND AND THE FUKY 3^3
and went to the foot of the stairs and listened for a moment.
There was no sound. She donned the overcoat and
the hat and went across to her cabin.
The rain had stopped. The air now drove out of the
southeast, broken overhead into blue patches. Upon the
crest of a hill beyond the trees and roofs and spires of town sunlight lay like a pale scrap of cloth, was blotted away. Upon the air a bell came, then as if at a signal,
other bells took up the sound and repeated it. The cabin door opened and Dilsey emerged, again in the maroon cape and the purple gown, and wearing
soiled white elbow-length gloves and minus her head'
cloth now. She came into the yard and called Luster. She
waited awhile, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, moving close to the wall, and looked
into the door. Ben sat on the steps. Before him Luster squatted on the damp floor. He held a saw in his left hand, tire blade sprung a httle by pressure of his hand,
and he was in the act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had been making beaten
biscuit for more than thirty years. The saw gave forth a single sluggish twang that ceased with hfeless alacrity,
leaving the blade in a thin clean curve between Luster s hand and the floor. Still, inscrutable, it bellied.
^'Dafls de way he done hit,” Luster said. "I jes aint foun
de right thing to hit it wid.”
^"Dafls whut you doin, is it?” Dilsey said. ‘‘Bring me dal
mallet,” she said. ‘T aint hurt hit,” Luster said. “Bring hit here,” Dilsey said. “Put dat saw whar you
got hit first.” He put the saw away and brought the mallet to hen
Then Ben wailed again, hopeless and prolonged. It waf* nothing. Just sound. It might have been all time and in-
504 THE SOUNB AND THE EUEY
justice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a conjunction
of planets.
"‘Listen at him,” Luster said, ""He been gwine on dat
way ev y
since you sont us outen de house. I dont know
whut got in to him dis mawnin.”
""Bring him here,” Dilsey said. ""Come on, Benjy,” Luster said. He went back down
the steps and took Ben s arm. He came obediently, wailing,
that slow hoarse sound that ships make, that seems
to begin before the sound itself has started, seems to cease before the sound itself has stopped.
""Run and git his cap,” Dilsey said. ""Dont make no
noise Miss Cahline kin hear. Hurry, now. We already
late.” ""She gwine hear him anyhow, ef you dont stop him,”
Luster said. ""He stop when we git off de place,” Dilsey said. ""He smellin hit. Dat's whut hit is ” ""Smell whut, mammy?” Luster said. ""You go git dat cap,” Dilsey said. Luster went on. They
stood in the cellar door, Ben one step below her. The sly was broken now into scudding patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of the shabby garden, over the
broken fence and across the yard. Dilsey stroked Bens
head, slowly and steadily, smoothing the bang upon his brow. He wailed quietly, unhurriedly. ""Hush,” Dilsey
said, ""Hush, now. We be gone in a minute. Hush, now
” He wailed quietly and steadily.
Luster returned, wearing a stiff new straw hat with a
coloured band and carrying a cloth cap. The hat seemed
to isolate Luster s skull, in the beholder s eye as a spotlight

peculiarly individual was its shape that at first glance the

hat appeared to be on the head of someone standing immediately
behind Luster. Dilsey looked at the hat. 'Whyn’t you wear yo old hat?’’ she said. ''Couldn’t find hit,” Luster said. '1 bet you couldn’t. I bet you fixed hit last night so you
couldn’t find hit. You fixin to ruin dat un.” "Aw, mammy,” Luster said, "Hit aint gwine rain.” "How you know? You go git dat old hat en put dat new un away.”
"Aw, mammy.”
"Den you go git de umbreller.”
"Aw, mammy.”
"Take yo choice,” Dilsey said. "Git yo old hat, er d^
umbreller. I dont keer which,”
Luster went to the cabin. Ben wailed quietly.
"Come on,” Dilsey said, "Dey kin ketch up wid us. We
gwine to hear de singin.” They went around the house,
toward the gate. "Hush,” Dilsey said from time to time as they went down the drive. They reached the gate. Dil- sey opened it. Luster was coming down the drive behind
them, carrying the umbrella. A woman was with him.
"Here dey come,” Dilsey said. They passed out the gate.
"Now, den,” she said. Ben ceased. Luster and his mothei
overtook them. Frony wore a dress of bright blue silk and a flowered hat. She was a thin woman, with a flat pleasant face. "You got six weeks’ work right dar on yo back,” Dilsey
said. "Whut you gwine do ef hit rain?”
"Git wet, I reckon,” Frony said. "I aint never stopped no rain yit.”
"Mammy always talkin bout hit gwine rain,” LusteJ
said. "Ef I dont worry bout y’all, I dont know who is,” Dilsey
said. "Come on, we already late.”
Jo6 S0XJ2:i) AND THE FUEY
'‘Rev’un Shegog gwine preach today/’ Frony said. “Is?” Dilsey said. “Who him?”
“He fum Saint Looey/’ Frony said. “Dat big
preacher.”
“Huh” Dilsey said, ‘Whut dey needs is a man kin put
de fear of God into dese here triflin young niggers.”
“Rev un Shegog gwine preach today/’ Frony said. “So
dey tells.” They went on along the street. Along its quiet length
white people in bright clumps moved churchward, under
the windy bells, walking now and then in the random
and tentative sun. The wind was gusty, out of the southeast,
chill and raw after the warm days.
“I wish you wouldn’t keep on bringin him to church,
mammy/’ Frony said. “Folks talkin.” “Whut folks?” Dilsey said.
“I hears em,” Frony said. “And I knows whut kind of folks,” Dilsey said, “Trash
white folks, Dat’s who it is. Thinks he aint good enough
fer white chui*ch, but nigger church aint good enough
fer him.”
“Dey talks, jes de same,” Frony said. “Den you send um to me,” Dilsey said. “Tell um de
good Lawd dont keer whether he smart er not. Dont no- body but white trash keer dat.” A street turned off at right angles, descending, and be- came a dirt road. On either hand the land dropped more
sharply; a broad flat dotted with small cabins whose
weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the
road. They were set in small grassless plots littered with
broken things, bricks, planks, crockery, things of a once
utilitarian value. What growth there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulbemes and locusts and sycamores—^trees that partook also of the foul desic-
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 307
cation which surrounded the houses; trees whose very
burgeoning seemed to be the sad and stubborn remnanf
of September, as if even spring had passed them by,
leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable
smell of negroes in which they grew.
From the doors negroes spoke to them as they passed,
to Dilsey usually:
‘'Sis' Gibson! How you dis mawnin?"
‘Tm well. Is you well?"
“I'm right well, I thank you.”
They emerged from the cabins and struggled up the
shading levee co the road—^men in staid, hard brown 01 black, with gold watch chains and now and then a stick; young men in cheap violent blues or stripes and swaggering
hats; women a httle stiffly sibilant, and children in garments bought second hand of white people, who
looked at Ben with the covertness of nocturnal animals:
“I bet you wont go up en tech him.”
“How come I w</interval><interval value=46 novelty=0.7762 residual=-0.0364 level=normal>ont?”
‘T bet you wont. I bet you skeered to.” “He wont hurt folks. He des a loony.”
“How come a loony wont hurt folks?” “Dat un wont. I teched him.”
‘T bet you wont now.”
“Case Miss Dilsey lookin.” “You wont no ways.”
“He dont hurt folks. He des a loony.”
And steadily the older people speaking to Dilsey,
though, unless they were quite old, Dilsey permitted
Frony to respond.
“Mammy aint feehn well dis mawnin.”
“Dat's too bad. But Rev'un Shegog'll cure dat. He'D
give her de comfort en de unburdenin.”
The road rose again, to a scene like a painted back'
3o8 the sound and the fuky
drop. Notched into a cut of red clay crowned with oaks
the road appeared to stop short oflE, like a cut ribbon.
Beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a painted church, and the whole scene was as fiat and
without perspective as a painted cardboard set upon the
ultimate edge of the fiat earth, against the windy sunlight
of space and April and a midmorning filled with bells. Toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation.
The women and children went on in, the men
stopped outside and talked in quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing. Then they too entered. The church had been decorated, with sparse flowers
from kitchen gardens and hedgerows, and with streamers
of coloured crepe paper. Above the pulpit hung a bat- tered Christmas bell, the accordion sort that collapses.
The pulpit was empty, though the choir was already in
place, fanning themselves although it was not warm.
Most of the women were gathered on one side of the room. They were talking. Then the bell struck one time
and they dispersed to their seats and the congregation sat
for an instant, expectant. The bell struck again one time.
The choir rose and began to sing and the congregation
turned its head as one, as six small children—^four girls
with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of clotli like
butterflies, and two boys with close napped heads,—entered
and marched up the aisle, strung together in a harness
of white ribbons and flowers, and followed by two men in single file. The second man was huge, of a light coffee colour, imposing in a frock coat and white tie. His
head was magisterial and profound, his neck rolled above
his collar in rich folds. But he was familiar to them, and
so the heads were still reverted when he had passed, and
it was not until the choir ceased singing that they real- ised that the visiting clergyman had already entered,
TI-IE SOUISTD AND THE EXIEY 309
and when they saw the man who had preceded then
minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescrib^ able sound went up, a sigh, a sound of astonishment and
disappointment.
The visitor was undersized, in a shabby alpaca coat. He had a wizened black face like a small, aged monkey.
And all the while that the choir sang again and while the
six children rose and sang in thin, frightened, tuneless
whispers, they watched the insignificant looking man
sitting dwarfed and countrified by the minister’s imposing
bulk, with something like consternation. They were still looking at him with consternation and unbelief when the
minister rose and introduced him in rich, rolling tones whose very unction served to increase the visitor’s insig- nificance. ''En dey brung dat all de way fum Saint Looey,” Frony
whispered.
Ive knowed de Lawd to use cuiser tools dan dat,”
Dilsey said, ''Hush, now,” she said to Ben, "Dey fibdn to sing again in a minute.”
When the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white man. His voice was level and cold. It sounded toe big to have come from him and they listened at first through
curiosity, as they would have to a monkey talking. They
began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope. They even forgot his insignificant appearance in the vir- tuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon
the cold inflectionless wire of his voice, so that at last, when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again
beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion
as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the congregation
sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved
a little in its seats. Behind the pulpit the choir fanned
310 THE SOTJHD AND THE FUKY
steadily* Dilsey whispered, '"Hush, now. Dey fixin to sing
in a minute.”
Then a voice said, "Brethren.”
The preacher had not moved. His arm lay yet across
the desk, and he still held that pose while the voice died
in sonorous echoes between the walls. It was as diflEerent as day and dark from his former tone, with a sad, timbrous
quality like an alto horn, sinking into their hearts
and speaking there again when it had ceased in fading
and cumulate echoes. "Brethren and sisteren,” it said again. The preacher re- moved his arm and he began to walk back and forth before
the desk, his hands clasped behind him, a meagre
figure, hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured
in striving with the implacable earth, "I got the
recollection and the blood of the Lamb!” He tramped
steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and
the Christmas bell, hunched, his hands clasped behind
him. He was like a worn small rock whehned by the successive
waves of his voice. With his body he seemed to feed the voice that, succubus like, had fleshed its teeth in
him. And the congregation seemed to watch with its ovm eyes while the voice consumed him, until he was
nothing and they were nodiing and tliere was not even a
voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another
in chanting measures beyond the need for words,
so that when he came to rest against the reading desk,
his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a
serene, tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness
and insignificance and made it of no moment, a long
moaning expulsion of breath rose from them, and a womans single soprano: ‘"Yes, Jesus!” As the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows
glowed and faded in ghostly retrograde. A car
THE SOUXB AKD THE EURY
passed along the road outside, labouring in the sand;
died away, Dilsey sat bolt upright, her hand on Bens
knee. Two tears slid down her fallen cheeks, in and out
of the myriad coruscations of immolation and abnegation
and time.
^'Brethren,'’ the minister said in a harsh whisper, with- out moving.
"Yes, Jesus!'’ The woman’s voice said, hushed yet.
"Breddren en sistuhn!” His voice rang again, with the
horns. He removed his arm and stood erect and raised
his hands. "I got de rickhckshun en de blood of de
Lamb!” They did not mark just when his intonation, his pronunciation, became negroid, they just sat swaying a
little in their seats as the voice took ihem into itself. "When de long, cold—Oh, I tells you, breddren, when
de long, cold—I sees de hght en J sees de word, po sin- ner! Dey passed away in Egypt, de swingin chariots; de
generations passed away. Wus a rich man: whar he now,

say, O breddren? O sistulm? Is you got de ricklickshun en de Blood of de Lamb? Case I aint gwine load down

and mopped his face. A low concerted sound rose from the congregation: "Mmmmmmmmmmmmm!” The
woman’s voice said, ""Yes, Jesus! Jesus!” "Breddren! Look at dem little chillen settin dar. Jesus wus like dat once. He mammy suffered de glory en de

whilst de angels singin him to sleep; maybe she look out

and forth, mopping his face. ''Listen, breddren! I sees de

angels singin de peaceful songs en de glory; I sees de

mammy widout de salvation en de word of God!”
"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Jesus! Little Jesus1” and another voice, rising:
"I sees, O Jesus! Oh I sees!” and still another, without
words, like bubbles rising in water.
"I sees hit, breddren! I sees hit! Sees de blastin, blindin
sight! I sees Calvary, wid de sacred trees, sees de thief en de murderer en de least of dese; I hears de boasting en de

"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. Jesus! I sees, O Jesus!” "O blind sinner! Breddren, I tells you; sistuhn, I says to you, when de Lawd did turn His mighty face, say, Aint

golden horns shoutin down de glory, en de arisen dead
whut got de blood en de ricklickshun of de Lamb!”
In the midst of the voices and the hands Ben sat, rapt
in his sweet blue gaze. Dilsey sat bolt upright beside, cry- ing rigidly and quietly in the annealment and the blood
of the remembered Lamb.
As they walked through the bright noon, up the sandy
road with the dispersing congregation talking easily
again group to group, she continued to weep, unmindful
of the tallc. “He sho a preacher, mon! He didn’t look like much at
first, b</interval><interval value=47 novelty=0.8942 residual=0.0825 level=high>ut hush!”
“He seed de power en de glory.”
‘"‘Yes, suh. He seed hit. Face to face he seed hit”
Dilsey made no sound, her face did not quiver as the
tears took their sunken and devious courses, walking with
her head up, making no effort to dry them away even. “Whyn t you quit dat, mammy?” Frony said. ‘Wid all dese people lookin. We be passin white folks soon.”
“I’ve seed de first en de last,” Dilsey said. “Never you
mind me.”
“First en last whut?” Frony said. “Never you mind,” Dilsey said. “I seed de beginnin, en now I sees de endin.”
Before they reached the street, though, she stopped
and lifted her skirt and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt. Then they went on. Ben shambled
along beside Dilsey, watching Luster who anticked
along ahead, the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in the sunlight, like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one. They reached the gate
and entered. Immediately Ben began to whimper again,
and for a while all of them looked up the drive at the
square, paintless house with its rotting portico.
314 THE SOGND AND THE J'UKT
^Whut’s gwine on up dar today?"' Frony said. ‘^Something
is.” "'Notliin,” Dilsey said. “You tend to yo business en let de white folks tend to deir n.” “Somethin is,” Frony said. “I heard him first thing dis mawnin. "Taint none of my business, dough.”
“En I knows whut, too,” Luster said. ‘TTou knows mo dan you got any use fer,” Dilsey said. “Aint you jes heard Frony say hit aint none of yo busi- ness? You take Benjy on to de back and keep him quiet
twell I put dinner on.”
“I knows whar Miss Quentin is,” Luster said. “Den jes keep hit/" Dilsey said. “Soon es Quentin need
any of yo egvice. Til let you know. Y’all g"awn en play in de back, now.”
“You know whut gwine happen soon es dey start playin
dat ball over yonder,” Luster said. “Dey wont start fer awhile yit. By dat time T. P. be
here to take him ridin. Here, you gimme dat new hat.” Luster gave her the hat and he and Ben went on
across the back yard. Ben was still whimpering, though
not loud. Dilsey and Frony went to the cabin. After a while Dilsey emerged, again in the faded calico dress, and
went to the kitchen. The fire had died down. There was
no sound in the house. She put on the apron and went up
stairs. There was no sound anywhere. Quentins room was
as they had left it. She entered and picked up the undergarment
and put the stocking back in the drawer and
closed it. Mrs Compsons door was closed. Dilsey stood
beside it for a moment, listening. Then she opened it and entered, entered a pervading reek of camphor. The
shades were drawn, the room in halflight, and the bed,
so that at first she thought Mrs Compson was asleep and
was about to close the door when the other spoke.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY jlj
‘Well?” she said, What is it?”
"'"Hit’s me,” Dilsey said. ""You want anything?”
Mrs Compson didn’t answer. After awhile, without
moving her head at all, she said: "Where’s Jason?”
""He aint come back yit,” Dilsey said. "Whut you
want?”
Mrs Compson said nothing. Like so many cold, weak
people, when faced at last by the incontrovertible disas- ter she exhumed from somewhere a sort of fortitude,
strength. In her case it was an unshakable conviction re- garding the yet unplumbed event. ""Well,” she said presently,
""Did you find it?” ""Find whut? Whut you talkin about?”
""The note. At least she would have enough considera-- tion to leave a note. Even Quentin did that.” "Whut you talkin about?” Dilsey said, ""Dont you know
she all right? I bet she be waUcin right in dis do’ befo
dark.”
""Fiddlesticks,” Mrs Compson said, ""It’s in the blood.
Like uncle, like niece. Or mother. I dont know which
would be worse. I dont seem to care.” ""Whut you keep on talkin that way fur?” Dilsey said. ""Whut she want to do anything like that fur?”
""I dont know. What reason did Quentin have? Under
God’s heaven what reason did he have? It cant be simply
to flout and hurt me. Whoever God is. He would not per- mit that. I’m a lady. You might not believe that from my
offspring, but I am.”
""You des wait en see,” Dilsey said. ‘"She be here by
night, right dar in her bed.” Mrs Compson said nothing.
The camphor-soaked cloth lay upon her brow. The black
robe lay across the foot of the bed. Dilsey stood with her
hand on the door knob.
"Well,” Mrs Compson said. “What do you want? Are
3I& the sound and the fury
you going to fix some dinner for Jason and Benjamin, or
not?'’ 'Jason aint come yit/’ Dilsey said. "I gwine fix somethin.
You sho you dont want nothin? Yo bottle still hot
enough?”
"You might hand me my Bible.”
"I give hit to you dis mawnin, befo I left.” "You laid it on the edge of the bed. How long did you
expect it to stay there?” Dilsey crossed to the bed and groped among the
shadows beneath the edge of it and found the Bible, face
down. She smoothed the bent pages and laid the book on
the bed again. Mrs Compson didn’t open her eyes. Her
hair and the pillow were the same color, beneath the
wimple of the medicated cloth she looked like an old nun
praying. "Dont put it there again,” she said, without
opening her eyes. "That’s where you put it before. Do
you want me to have to get out of bed to pick it up?”
Dilsey reached the book across her and laid it on the
broad side of the bed. "You cant see to read, noways,”
she said. "You want me to raise de shade a little?” "No. Let them alone. Go on and fix Jason something to
eat.” Dilsey went out. She closed the door and returned to the kitchen. The stove was almost cold. While she stood
there the clock above the cupboard struck ten times. "One oclock,” she said aloud, "Jason aint comin home. Ise seed de first en de last,” she said, looking at the cold
stove, "I seed de first en de last.” She set out some cold
food on a table. As she moved back and forth she sang a hymn. She sang the first two lines over and over to die
complete tune. She arranged the meal and went to the
door and called Luster, and after a time Luster and Ben
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 3x7
entered. Ben was still moaning a little, as to himself. "He aint never quit,” Luster said. Y all come on en eat,” Dilsey said. "Jason aint coming
to dinner.” They sat down at the table. Ben could manage
solid food pretty well for himself, though even now,
with cold food before him, Dilsey tied a cloth about his neck. He and Luster ate. Dilsey moved about the kitchen,
singing the two lines of the hymn which she remembered.
"Y'all kin g’awn en eat,” she said, "Jason aint comin
home.”
He was twenty miles away at that time. When he left the house he drove rapidly to town, overreaching the
slow sabbath groups and the peremptory bells along the
broken air. He crossed the empty square and turned into a narrow street that was abruptly quieter even yet, and
stopped before a frame house and went up the flower- bordered walk to the porch.
Beyond the screen door people were talking. As he
lifted his hand to knock he heard steps, so he withheld
his hand until a big man in black broadcloth trousers and
a stiff-bosomed white shirt without collar opened the
door. He had vigorous untidy iron-grey hair and his grey
eyes were round and shiny like a little boy’s. He took
Jason s hand and drew him into the house, still shaking it. "Come right in,” he said, "Come right in.” "You ready to go now?” Jason said. "Walk right in,” the other said, propelling him by the
elbow into a room where a man and a woman sat. "You
know Myrtle’s husband, don’t you? Jason Compson,
Vernon.”
'"Yes,” Jason said. He did not even look at the man,
and as the sheriff drew a chair across the room the man
said.
3lS THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
"Well go out so you can talk. Come on, Myrtle.”
""No, no,” the sheriff said, ""You folks keep your seat. I reckon it aint that serious, Jason? Have a seat.”
""Ill tell you as we go along,” Jason said. ""Get your hat
and coat.” ""Well go out,” the man said, rising.
""Keep your seat,” the sheriff said. ‘"Me and Jason will go out on the porch.”
""You get your hat and coat,” Jason said. ""They’ve
already got a twelve hour start.” The sheriff led the way
back to the porch. A man and a woman passing spoke to him. He responded with a hearty florid gesture. Bells were still ringing, from the direction of the section known
as Nigger Hollow. ""Get your hat, Sheriff,” Jason said. The sheriff drew up two chairs. ""Have a seat and tell me what the trouble is.”
""I told you over the phone,” Jason said, standing. ""I did that to save time. Am I going to have to go to law to compel you to do your sworn duty?”
""You sit dovvTi and tell me about it” the sheriff said.
""Ill take care of you all right.”
""Care, hell,” Jason said. "‘Is this what you call taking
care of me?”
""You’re the one that’s holding us up,” the sheriff said. ""You sit down and tell me about it.” Jason told him, his sense of injury and impotence feeding
upon its own sound, so that after a time he forgot his haste in the violent cumulation of his self justification and
his outrage. The sheriff watched him steadily with his cold shiny eyes.
""But you dont know they done it,” he said. ""You just
think so.” ""Dont know?” Jason said. ""When I spent two damn
days chasing her through alleys, trying to keep her away

from him, after I told her what Td do to her if I ever caught her with him, and you say I dont know that that
Httle b—
“Now, then,” the sheriff said, “Thatll do. Thafs
enough of that.” He looked out across the street, his hands in his pockets.
“And when I come to you, a commissioned oflScer of the law,” Jason said. “That show's in Mottson this week,” the sheriff said.
‘"Yes,” Jason said, “And if I could find a law oiBScer that gave a sohtary damn about protecting the people that elected him to office, I’d be there too by now.” He re- peated his story, harshly recapitulant, seeming to get an
actual pleasure out of his outrage and impotence. The
sheriff did not appear to be listening at all. “Jason,” he said, “What were you doing with, three th</interval><interval value=48 novelty=0.8071 residual=-0.0037 level=normal>ousand dollars hid in the house?”
“What?” Jason said. “That’s my business where I keep
my money. Your business is to help me get it back.”
“Did your mother know you had that much on the
place?”
“Look here,” Jason said, “My house has been robbed.
I know who did it and I know where they are. I come
to you as the commissioned officer of the law, and I asl you once more, are you going to make any effort to re^ cover my property, or not?”
“What do you aim to do with that girl, if you catch
them?”
“Nothing,” Jason said, “Not anything. I wouldn’t lay
my hand on her. The bitch that cost me a job, the one chance I ever had to get ahead, that killed my father and
is shortening my mother’s life every day and made my
name a laughing stock in the town. I wont do anything
to her,” he said. “Not anything.”
3^0 THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
"You drove that girl into running oflf, Jason,” the
sheriflE said. "How I conduct my family is no business of yours,” Jason said. "Are you going to help me or not?”
"You drove her away from home,” the sheriff said. "And I have some suspicions about who that money belongs
to that I dont reckon 111 ever know for certain.” Jason stood, slowly wringing the brim of his hat in his hands. He said quietly: "Youre not going to make any
effort to catch them for me?”
"That’s not any of my business, Jason. If you had any
actual proof, Td have to act. But without that I dont
figger its any of my business.”
"That’s your answer, is it?” Jason said. ""Think well,
now.”
""That’s it, Jason.”
""All right,” Jason said. He put his hat on. "You’ll regret
dris. I wont be helpless. This is not Russia, where just
because he wears a little metal badge, a man is immune
to law.” He went down the steps and got in his car and
started the engine. The sheriff watched him drive away,
turn, and rush past the house toward town.
The bells were ringing again, high in the scudding
sunlight in bright disorderly tatters of sound. He stopped
at a filHng station and had his tires examined and the tank
filled. "Gwine on a trip, is you?” the negro asked him. He
didn’t answer. ""Look like hit gwine fair off, after all,” the negro said.
""Fair off, hell,” Jason said, "It’ll be raining like hell by
twelve oclock.” He looked at the sky, thinking about rain,
about the slick clay roads, himself stalled somewhere
miles from town. He thought about it with a sort of triumph, of the fact that he was going to miss dinner,
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 321
that by starting now and so serving his compulsion of haste, he would be at the greatest possible distance from
both towns when noon came. It seemed to him that, in
this, circumstance was giving him a break, so he said to the negro:
What the hell are you doing? Has somebody paid you
to keep this car standing here as long as you can?”
Dis here ti aint got no air a-tall in hit,” the negro
said.Then get the hell away from there and let me have
that tube,” Jason said.
"‘Hit up now,” the negro said, rising. “You kin ride now.”
Jason got in and started the engine and drove off. He
went into second gear, the engine spluttering and gasping,
and he raced the engine, jamming the throttle down
and snapping the choker in and out savagely. “It’s goin
to rain,” he said, “Get me half way there, and rain like heU.” And he drove on out of the bells and out of town,
thinking of himself slogging through the mud, hunting a
team. “And every damn one of them will be at church.”
He thought how he’d find a church at last and take a team and of the owner coming out, shouting at him and
of himself striking the man down. “I’m Jason Compson.
See if you can stop me. See if you can elect a man to
oflBce that can stop me,” he said, thinking of himself
entering the courthouse with a file of soldiers and
dragging the sheriff out. “Thinks he can sit with his hands folded and see me lose my job. I’ll show him about
jobs.” Of his niece he did not think at all, nor the arbi- trary valuation of the money. Neither of them had had
entity or individuality for him for ten years; together
they merely symbolized the job in the bank of which he
had been deprived before he ever got it.
322 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
The air brightened, the running shadow patches were
not the obverse, and it seemed to him that the fact that the day was clearing was another cunning stroke on the
part of the foe, the fresh battle toward wliich he was
carrying ancient wounds. From time to time he passed
churches, unpainted frame buildings with sheet iron
steeples, surrounded by tethered teams and shabby
motorcars, and it seemed to him that each of them was a
picket-post where the rear guards of Circumstance
peeped fleetingly back at him. “And damn You, too,” he
said, “See if You can stop me,” thinking of himself, his
file of soldiers with the manacled sheriff in the rear, dragging Omnipotence down from His throne, if necessary;
of the embattled legions of both hell and heaven
through which he tore his way and put his hands at lasc on his fleeing niece. The wind was out of the southeast. It blew steadily
upon his cheek. It seemed that he could feel the prolonged
blow of it sinking through his skull, and suddenly
with an old premonition he clapped the brakes on and
stopped and sat perfectly still. Then he lifted his hand
to his neck and began to curse, and sat there, ciursing in
a harsh whisper. When it was necessary for him to drive
for any length of time he fortified himself with a handkerchief
soaked in camphor, which he would tie about
his throat when clear of town, thus inhaling the fumes,
and he got out and lifted the seat cushion on the chance
that there might be a forgotten one tiiere. He looked
beneath both seats and stood again for a while, cursing,
seeing himself mocked by his own triumphing. He closed
his eyes, leaning on the door. He could return and get
the forgotten camphor, or he could go on. In either case,
his head would be splitting, but at home he could be
sure of finding camphor on Sunday, while if he went on
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 323
he could not be sure. But if he went back, he would be
an hour and a half later in reaching Mottson. “Maybe I can drive slow,” he said. “Maybe I can drive slow, think- ing of something else—
”
He got in and started. “I’ll think of something else,”
he said, so he thought about Lorraine. He imagined himself
in bed with her, only he was just lying beside her,
pleading with her to help him, then he thought of the
money again, and that he had been outv/itted by a woman, a girl. If he could just believe it was the man who
had robbed him. But to have been robbed of that which was to have compensated him for the lost job, which he
had acquired through so much effort and risk, by the very symbol of the lost job itself, and worst of all, by a
bitch of a girl. He drove on, shielding his face fiom the
steady wind with the corner of his coat. He could see the opposed forces of his destiny and his will drawing swiftly together now, toward a junction
that would be irrevocable; he became cunning. I cant make a blunder, he told himself. There would be just one right thing, without alternatives: he must do that. He beheved that both of them would know him on sight,
while he’d have to trust to seeing her first, unless the man still wore the red tie. And the fact that he must depend
on that red tie seemed to be the sum of the impending
disaster; he could almost smell it, feel it above the
throbbing of his head.
He crested the final hill. Smoke lay in the valley, and
roofs, a spire or two above trees. He drove down the hill and into the town, slowing, telling himself again of the
need for caution, to find where the tent was located first. He could not see very well now, and he knew that it was
the disaster which kept telling him to go directly and get
something for his head. At a filling station they told him
324 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
that the tent was not up yet, but that the show cars were
on a siding at the station. He drove there. Two gaudily painted pullman cars stood on the track. He reconnoitred them before he got out. He was trying
to breathe shallowly, so that the blood would not beat
so in his skull. He got out and went along the station
wall, watching the cars. A few garments hung out of the windows, hmp and crinkled, as though tliey had been
recently laundered. On the earth beside the steps of one sat three canvas chairs. But he saw no sign of life at all until a man in a dirty apron came to the door and
emptied a pan of dishwater with a broad gesture, the
sunlight glinting on the metal belly of the pan, then
entered the car again.
Now 111 have to take him by surprise, before he can warn them, he thought. It never occurred to him that they might not be there, in the car. That they should not
be there, that the whole result should not hinge on
whether he saw them first or they saw him first, would
be opposed to all nature and contrary to the whole
rhythm of events. And more than that: he must see them
first, get the money back, then what they did would be of no importance to him, while otherwise the whole world
would know that he, Jason Compson, had been robbed
by Quentin, his niece, a bitch. He reconnoitred again. Then he went to the car and
mounted the steps, swiftly and quietly, and paused at the door. The galley was dark, rank with stale food. The
man was a white blur, singing in a cracked, shaky tenor. An old man, he thought, and not as big as I am. He
entered the car as the man looked up.
"‘Hey?” the man said, stopping his song.
‘"Where are they?” Jason said. “Quick, now. In the
sleeping car?”
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 3Z5
'Wheres who?’’ the man said. “Dont he to me,” Jason said. He blundered on in the
cluttered obscurity.
'What’s that?” the other said, 'Who you calhng a Har?”
And when Jason grasped his shoulder he exclaimed,
"Look out, fellow!” "Dont he,” Jason said, 'Where are they?”
"Why, you bastard,” the man said. His arm was frail and thin in Jason’s grasp. He tried to wrench free, then
he turned and feU to scrabbling on the</interval><interval value=49 novelty=0.8147 residual=0.0048 level=normal> httered table behind him.
"Come on,” Jason said, "Where are they?”
"I’ll tell you where they are,” the man shrieked,
"Lemme find my butcher knife.” "Here,” Jason said, trying to hold the other, "I’m just
asking you a question.”
"You bastard,” the other shrieked, scrabbling at the
table. Jason tried to grasp him in both arms, trying to prison the puny fury of him. The man’s body felt so old, so frail, yet so fatally single-purposed that for the first time Jason saw clear and unshadowed the disaster toward
which he rushed.
"Quit it!” he said, "Here! Here! I’ll get out. Give me
time, and I’ll get out.” "Call me a liar,” the other wailed, "Lemme go. Lemme
go just one minute. I’ll show you.”
Jason glared wildly about, holding the other. Outside
it was now bright and sunny, swift and bright and empty,
and he thought of the people soon to be going quietly
home to Sunday dinner, decorously festive, and of himself
trying to hold the fatal, furious httle old man whom
he dared not release long enough to turn his back and
run.'Will you quit long enough for me to get out?” he
iz6 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
said, 'Will you?” But the other still struggled, and Jason
freed one hand and struck him on the head. A clumsy,
hurried blow, and not hard, but the other slumped immediately
and shd clattering among pans and buckets
to the floor. Jason stood above him, panting, listening.
Then he turned and ran from the car. At the door he
restrained himself and descended more slowly and stood
there again. His breath made a hah hah hah sound and
he stood there trying to repress it, darting his gaze this way and that, when at a scufiBing sound behind him he
turned in time to see the little old man leaping awkwardly
and furiously from the vestibule, a rusty hatchet
high in his hand.
He grasped at the hatchet, feeling no shock but knowing
that he was falling, thinking So this is how it'll end,
and he believed that he was about to die and when
something crashed against the back of his head he
thought How did he hit me there? Only maybe he hit me a long time ago, he thought, And I just now felt it, and he thought Hurry. Hurry. Get it over with, and then a furious desire not to die seized him and he struggled,
hearing the old man wailing and cursing in his cracked
voice. He still struggled when they hauled him to his feet,
but they held him and he ceased. "Am I bleeding much?” he said, "The back of my
head. Am I bleeding?” He was still saying that while he
felt himself being propelled rapidly away, heard the old
mans thin furious voice dying away behind him. "Look
at my head,” he said, "Wait, I
—
'Wait, hell,” the man who held him said, "That damn
little waspll kill you. Keep going. You aint hurt.” "He hit me,” Jason said. "Am I bleeding?”
"Keep going,” the other said. He led Jason on around
THE SOUND AND THE EURY 327
the corner of the station, to the empty platform where
an express truck stood, where grass grew rigidly in a plot
bordered with rigid flowers and a sign in electric lights:
Keep your eye on Mottson, the gap filled by
an eye with an electiic pupil. The man released
him.
''Now,’’ he said, "You get on out of here and stay out. What were you trying to do? Commit suicide?”
"I was looking for two people,” Jason said. "I just
asked him where they were.”
"Who you looking for?”
"It’s a girl,” Jason said. "And a man. He had on a red tie in Jefferson yesterday. With this show. They robbed me.”
"Oh,” the man said. "You’re the one, are you. Well,
they aint here.”
"I reckon so,” Jason said. He leaned against the wall
and put his hand to the back of his head and looked at
his palm. "I thought I was bleeding,” he said. "I thought
he hit me with that hatchet.” "You hit your head on the rail,” the man said. 'Tou
better go on. They aint here.”
‘Tes. He said tliey were not here. I thought he was
lying-”
"Do you think I’m lying?” the man said. "No,” Jason said. "I know they’re not here.”
"I told him to get the hell out of there, both of them,”
the man said. "I wont have nothing hke that in my show.
I run a respectable show, with a respectable troupe.”
"Yes,” Jason said. "You dont know where they went?”
"No. And I dont want to know. No member of my show
can pull a stunt like that. You her—^brother?” "No,” Jason said. "It dont matter. I just wanted to see them. You sure he didn’t hit me? No blood, I mean.”
"There would have been blood if I hadn’t got there
)28 THE SOUND AND THE FURY
when I did. You stay away from here, now. That little bastardll Idll you. That your car yonder?”
"Yes.” "Well, you get in it and go back to Jefferson. If you
find tliem, it wont be in my show. I run a respectable
show. You say they robbed you?”
"No,” Jason said, "It dont make any difference.” He
went to the car and got in. What is it I must do? he
thought. Then he remembered. He started the engine and
drove slowly up the street until he found a drugstore. The
door was locked. He stood for a while with his hand on
the knob and his head bent a little. Then he turned away
and when a man came along after a while he asked if there was a drugstore open anywhere, but there was not. Then he asked when the northbound train ran, and the
man told him at two thirty. He crossed the pavement and
got in the car again and sat there. After a while two
negro lads passed. He called to them.
""Can either of you boys drive a car?”
""Yes, suh.” ""Whatll you charge to drive me to Jefferson right
away?”
They looked at one another, murmuring.
""ril pay a dollar,” Jason said. They murmured again. ""Couldn’t go fer dat,” one said. "What will you go for?”
""Kin you go?” one said.
""I cant git off,” the other said. ""Whyn t you drive him
up dar? You aint got nothin to do.”
"Y-es I is.” "Whut you got to do?”
They murmured again, laughing.
""Til give you two dollars,” Jason said. ""Either of you.”
""I cant git away neither,” the first said.
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 3 ^^
"All right/" Jason said. "Go on.’" He sat there for sometime. He heard a clock strike the
half hour, then people began to pass, in Sunday and
Easter clothes. Some looked at him as they passed, at the man sitting quietly behind the wheel of a small car, with his invisible life ravelled out about him like a wornout
sock. After a while a negro in overalls came up.
"Is you de one wants to go to Jefferson?” he said.
'"Yes,” Jason said. "Whatll you charge me?”
"Fo doJlars.” "Give you two.”
"Cant go fer no less’n fo."' The man in the car sat quietly. He wasn’t even looking at him. The negro said,
"You want me er not?”
"All right,” Jason said, "Get in.” He moved over and the negro took the wheel. Jason
closed his eyes. I can get something for it at Jefferson,
he told himself, easing himself to the jolting, I can get
something there. They drove on, along the streets where
people were turning peacefully into houses and Sunday
dinners, and on out of town. He thought that. He wasn’t thinking of home, where Ben and Luster were eating
cold dinner at the kitchen table. Something—the absence
of disaster, threat, in any constant evil—^permitted him
to forget Jefferson as any place which he had ever seen
before, where his life must resume itself. When Ben and Luster were done Dilsey sent them
outdoors. "And see kin you keep let him alone twell fo
oclock. T. P. be here den.”
"Yessum,” Luster said. They went out. Dilsey ate her
dinner and cleared up the kitchen. Then she went to the
foot of the stairs and listened, but there was no sound.
She returned through the kitchen and out the outer door
and stopped on the steps. Ben and Luster were not in
33^ THE SOUND AND THE EUH'T
sight, but while she stood there she heard another sluggish
twang from the direction of the cellar door and she
went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of the morning’s scene.
“"'He done it jes dat way,” Luster said. He contemplated
the motionless saw with a kind of hopeful dejection.
aint got de right thing to hit it wid yit,” he said. ‘'En you aint gwine find hit down here, neither,” Dilsey
sa^’d. "^ou take him on out in de sun. You bofe get
pneumonia down here on dis wet flo.” She waited and watched them cross the yard toward
a clump of cedar trees near the fence. Then she went on
to her cabin. ‘"Now, dont you git started,” Luster said, "1 had enough
trouble wid you today.” There was a hammock made of
barrel staves slatted into woven wires. Luster lay down
in the swing, but Ben went on vaguely and purposelessly.
He began to whimper again. “Hush, now,” Luster said, “I fixin to whup you.” He lay back in the swing. Ben had
stopped moving, but Luster could hear him whimpering.
“Is you gwine hush, er aint you?” Luster said. He got up
and followed and came upon Ben squatting before a
small mound of eaiih. At either end of it an empty bottle
of blue glass that once contained poison was fixed in the
ground. In one was a withered stalk of jimson weed, Ben
squatted before it, moaning, a slow, inarticulate sound.
Still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig
and put it in the other bottle. “Whyn t you hush?” Luster
said, 'TTou want me to give you somethin’ to sho nough moan about? Sposin I does dis.” He knelt and swept the
bottle suddenly up and behind him. Ben ceased moaning.
He squatted, looking at the small depression where the
bottle had sat, then as he drew his lungs full Luster
brought the bottle back into view. “Hush!” he hissed,
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 33^
"Dont you dast to beller! Dont you. Dar hit is. See? Here. You fixin to start ef you stays here. Come on, les go see
ef dey started knockin ball yit.” He took Bens arm and
drew him up and they went to the fence and stood side by side tliere, peering between the matted honeysuckle
not yet in bloom.
“Dar," Luster said, “Dar come some. See um?"
They watched the foursome play onto the green and
out, and move to the tee and drive. Ben watched, whimpering,
slobbering. When the foursome went on he fol- lowed along the fence, bobbing and moaning. One said. “Here, caddie. Bring the bag."
“Hush, Benjy," Luster said, but Ben went on </interval><interval value=50 novelty=0.7814 residual=-0.0276 level=normal>at his shambling trot, clinging to the fence, wailing in his hoarse, hopeless voice. The man played and went on, Ben keeping pace with him until the fence turned at right angles, and he clung to the fence, watching the
people move on and away.
“Will you hush now?" Luster said, “Will you hush
now?" He shook Bens arm. Ben clung to the fence,
wailing steadily and hoarsely. “Aint you gwine stop?"
Luster said, "Or is you?" Ben gazed through the fence. “All right, den," Luster said, 'Tou want somethin to beller about?" He looked over his shoulder, toward the
house. Then he whispered: “Caddy! Beller now. Caddy!
Caddy! Caddy!"
A moment later, in the slow intervals of Bens voice,
Luster heard Dilsey calling. He took Ben by the arm and
they crossed the yard toward her.
“I tole you he warht gwine stay quiet," Luster said. “You vilyunl" Dilsey said, 'Whut you dont to him?"
“I aint done nothin. I tole you when dem folks start playin, he git started up."
'Tou come on here," Dilsey said. “Hush, Benjy. Hush,
33^ THE SOUND AND THE EURY
now/" But he wouldn’t hush. They crossed the yard
quickly and went to the cabin and entered. "'Run git dat
shoe/" Dilsey said. “Dont you sturb Miss Cahline, now.
Ef she say anything, tell her I got him. Go on, now; you
kin sho do dat right, I reckon."" Luster went out. Dilsey
led Ben to the bed and drew him do^Aui beside her and
she held him, rocking back and forth, wiping his drooling
mouth upon the hem of her skirt. "Hush, now,"" she said,
sticking his head, “Hush. Dilsey got you."" But he bel- lowed slowly, abjectly, without tears; the grave hopeless
sound of all voiceless misery under the sun. Luster re- turned, carrying a white satin slipper. It was yellow now,
and cracked and soiled, and when they placed it into Bens hand he hushed for a while. But he still whimpered,
and soon he lifted his voice again.
“You reckon you kin find T. B.?"" Dilsey said. “He say yistiddy he gwine out to St Johns today. Say
he be back at fo."" Dilsey rocked back and forth, stroking Ben’s head.
“Dis long time, O Jesus,"" she said, “Dis long time."" “I kin drive dat surrey, mammy/" Luster said. “You kill bofe y"all,"" Dilsey said. 'Tou do hit fer devil- ment. I knows you got plenty sense to. But I cant trust you. Hush, now,"" she said. “Hush. Hush.”
“Nome I wont,” Luster said. “I drives vdd T. P.” Dilsey
rocked back and forth, holding Ben. "Miss Cahhne
say ef you cant quiet him, she gwine git up en come down en do hit."" “Hush, honey,” Dilsey said, stroking Ben’s head. “Luster,
honey,” she said, “Will you think about yo ole mammy en drive dat «urrey right?”
“Yessum,” Luster said. “I drive hit jes like T. P.” Dilsey stroked Ben’s head, rocking back and forth.
‘T does de bes I kin,” she said, “Lawd knows dat. Go
THE SOUND AND THE FURY 333
git it, den/’ she said, rising. Luster scuttled out. Ben held
die slipper, crying. "'Hush, now. Luster gone to git de
surrey en take you to de graveyard. We aint gwine risk gitting yo cap,” she said. She went to a closet contrived
of a calico curtain hung across a corner of the room
and got the felt hat she had worn. 'We’s down to worse n
dis, ef folks jes knowed,” she said. "You s de Lawd’s chile,
anyway. En I be Hish too, fo long, praise Jesus. Here.”
She put the hat on his head and buttoned his coat. He
wailed steadily. She took the slipper from him and put it away and they went out. Luster came up, with an ancient
white horse in a battered and lopsided surrey. ‘Tou gwine be careful, Luster?” she said. "Yessum,” Luster said. She helped Ben into the back
seat. He had ceased crying, but now he began to whimper
again.
"Hit s his flower,” Luster said. 'Wait, 111 git him one.” 'Tou set right dar,” Dilsey said. She went and took the
cheekstrap. "Now, hurry en git him one.” Luster ran around the house, toward the garden. He came back with
a single narcissus. "Dat un broke,” Dilsey said, "Whyn t you git him a good un?”
"Hit de onliest one I could find,” Luster said. "Y’all took all of um Friday to decrate de church. Wait, 111
hit.” So while Dilsey held the horse Luster put a splint on the flower stalk with a twig and two bits of string
and gave it to Ben. Then he mounted and took the reins. Dilsey still held the bridle. "You knows de way now?” she said, "Up de street, round de square, to de graveyard, den staight bach
home.”
"Yessum,” Luster said, "Hum up, Queenie ” "You gwine be careful, now?”
534 THE SOUND AND THE EURY
^‘Yessum ” Dilsey released the bridle. ‘'Hum up, Queenie,” Luster said. "Here/" Dilsey said, "You han me dat whup.""
"Aw, mammy,’" Luster said. "Give hit here,” Dilsey said, approaching the wheel.
Luster gave it to her reluctantly.
"I wont never git Queenie started now.”
"Never you mind about dat,” Dilsey said. "Queenie
(enow mo bout whar she gwine dan you does. All you
got to do is set dar en hold dem reins. You knows de
way, now?”
"Yessum. Same way T. P. goes ev") Sunday.”
"Den you do de same thing dis Sunday.”
"Cose I is. Aint I drove fer T. P. mon a hund’ed times?”
"Den do hit again,” Dilsey said. "G’avm, now. En ef you hurts Benjy, nigger boy, I dont Icnow whut I do. You bound fer de chain gang, but I’ll send you dar fo even chain gang ready fer you.”
'Tfessum,” Luster said. "Hum up, Queenie.”
He flapped the lines on Queenie’s broad back and the
surrey lurched into motion.
"You, Luster!” Dilsey said. 'Hum up, dar!” Luster said. He flapped the lines again.
With subterranean rumbhngs Queenie jogged slowly
down the drive and turned into the street, where Luster
exhorted her into a gait resembling a prolonged and sus- pended fall in a forw^ard direction. Ben quit whimpering. He sat in the middle of the seat, holding the repaired flower upright in his fist, his eyes
serene and ineffable. Directly before him Luster s bullet head turned backward continually until the house passed
from view, then he pulled to the side of the street and
while Ben watched him he descended and broke a switch
from a hedge. Queenie lowered her head and fell to
THE SOUND AND THE FUEY 33J
cropping the grass until Luster mounted and hauled her
head up and harried her into motion again, then he
squared his elbows and with the switch and the reins held high he assumed a swaggering attitude out of all proportion to the sedate clopping of Queenie's hooves
and the organlike basso of her internal accompaniment.
Motors passed them, and pedestrians; once a group of
half grown negroes:
''Dar Luster. Whar you gwine. Luster? To de bone
yard?'’
‘"Hi,” Luster said, "Aint de same boneyard y'all headed
fer. Hum up, elefump.”
They approached the square, where the Confederate
soldier gazed with empty eyes beneath his marble hand
into wind and weather. Luster took still another notch
in himself and gave the impervious Queenie a cut with
the switch, casting his glance about the square. "‘Dar Mr
Jasons car,” he said tiaen he spied another group of negroes. "Xes show dem niggers how quality does,
Benjy,” he said, ""Whut you say?” He looked back. Ben
sat, holding the flower in his fist, his gaze empty and untroubled.
Luster hit Queenie again and swung her to the
left at the monument.
For an instant Ben sat in an utter hiatus. Then he
bellowed. Bellow on bellow, his voice mounted, with
scarce interval for breath. There was more than astonish** ment in it, it was horror; shock; agony eyeless, tongue*
less; just sound, and Luster s eyes back-rolling for a white
instant. "Gret God,” he said, "Hush! Hush! Gret God!”
He whirled again and struck Queenie with the switch. It broke and he cast it away and with Ben s voice mounting
toward its unbelievable crescendo Luster caught up the
end of the reins and leaned forward as Jason came jumping
across the square and onto the step.
33^ THE SOUND AND THE FUEY
With a backhanded blow he hurled Luster aside and
caught the reins and sawed Queenie about and doubled
the reins back and slashed her across the hips. He cut her again and again, into a plunging gallop, while Bens
hoarse agony roared about them, and swung her about
to the right of the monument. They he struck Luster over
the head with his fist. '"Dont you know any better than to take him to die
left?” he said. He reached back and struck Ben, breaking
the flower stalk again. "'Shut up!” he said, ‘'Shut up!” He
jerked Queenie back and jumped down. "Get to hell on home with him. If you ever cross that gate with him
again, 111 kill you!”
"Yes, suhl” Luster said. He took the reins and hit Queenie with the end of them. "Git up! Git up, darl Benjy, fer God’s sake!” Bens voice roared and roared. Queenie moved again,
her feet began to clop-clop steadily again, and at once Ben hushed. Luster looked quickly back over his shoulder,
then he drove on. The broken flower drooped over Ben s fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice and fagade flowed smoothly once more
from left to right; post and tree, window and doorway,
and signboard, each in its ordered place.
