JEWEL AND I COME UP FBOM THE FIElD, FOLLOWING THE
path in single file. Although I am fifteen feet ahead of him, anyone watching us from the cotton-house can see Jewel’s frayed and broken straw hat a full head above
my own. The path runs straight as a plumb-line, worn smooth
by feet and baked brick-hard by July, between the green rows of laid-by cotton, to the cotton-house in the centre
of the field, where it turns and circles the cotton-house at four soft right angles and goes on across the field again, worn so by feet in fading precision.
The cotton-house is of rough logs, from between which
the chinking has long fallen. Square, with a broken roof
set at a single pitch, it leans in empty and shimmering
dilapidation in the sunlight, a single broad window in two opposite walls giving on to the approaches of the
path. When we reach it I turn and follow the path which
circles the house. Jewel, fifteen feet behind me, looking
straight ahead, steps in a single stride through the window.
Still staring straight ahead, his pale eyes like wood
set into his wooden face, he crosses the floor in four
strides with the rigid gravity of a cigar-store Indian
dressed in patched overalls and endued with life from
the hips down, and steps in a single stride through the opposite window and into the path again just as I come
around the comer. In single file and five feet apart and
Jewel now in front, we go on up the path toward the
foot of the bluff. 339

Tulls wagon stands beside the spring, hitched to the
rail, the reins wrapped about the seat stanchion. In the
wagon-bed are two chairs. Jewel stops at the spring and
takes the gourd from the willow branch and drinks. I pass him and mount the path, beginning to hear Cash’s
saw.When I reach the top he has quit sawing. Standing in a litter of chips, he is fitting two of the boards together.
Between the shadow spaces they are yellow as gold, like
soft gold, bearing on their flanks in smooth undulations
the marks of the adze blade: a good carpenter. Cash is. He holds the two planks on the trestle, fitted along the
edges in a quarter of the finished box. He kneels and
squints along the edge of them, then he lowers them and
takes up the adze. A good carpenter. Addie Bundren
could not want a better one, a better box to lie in. It will give her confidence and comfort. I go on to the house,
followed by the

O I SAVED OUT THE EGGS AND BAKED YESTEBDAY. THE
cakes turned out right well. We depend a lot on our
chickens. They are good layers, what few we have left after the possums and such. Snakes, too, in the summer. k snake will break up a hen-house quicker than any-
AS I LAY DYING 341
thing. So after they were going to cost so much more
than Mr. Tull thought, and after I promised that the dif- ference in the number of eggs would make it up, I had
to be more careful than ever because it was on my final say-so we took them. We could have stocked cheaper
chickens, but I gave my promise as Miss Lavmgton said
when she advised me to get a good breed, because Mr.
Tull himself admits that a good breed of cows or hogs
pays in the long run. So when we lost so many of them
we couldn’t afford to use the eggs ourselves, because I could not have had Mr. Tull chide me when it was on my say-so we took them. So when Miss Lawington told me about the cakes I thought that I could bake them
and earn enough at one time to increase the net value of the flock the equivalent of two head. And that by saving
the eggs out one at a time, even the eggs wouldn’t be
costing anything. And that week they laid so well that
I not only saved out enough eggs above what we had
engaged to sell, to bake &e cakes with, I had saved
enough so that the flour and the sugar and the stove wood would not be costing anything. So I baked yesterday,
more careful than ever I baked in my life, and the
cakes turned out right well. But when we got to town
this morning Miss Lawington told me the lady had
changed her mind and was not going to have the party
after all. "She ought to taken those cakes anyway,” Kate says. 'Well,” I say, "I reckon she never had no use for them
now.”
"She ought to taken them,” Kate says. "But those rich town ladies can change their minds. Poor folks can’t.” Riches is nothing in the face of the Lord, for He can
see into the heart. "Maybe I can sell them at the bazaar
Saturday,” I say. They turned out real well.
342 AS I LAY LYING
‘Tfou can t get two dollars a piece for them/' Kate says. *WelI, it isn’t like they cost me anything,” I say. 1 saved them i out and swapped a dozen of them for the
sugar and flour. It isn’t like the cakes cost me anything,
as Mr. Tull himself realizes tliat the eggs I saved were
over and beyond what we had engaged to sell, so it was
like we had found the eggs or they had been given to
us.''She ought to taken those cakes when she same as gave you her word,” Kate says. The Lord can see into the heart. If it is His will that some folks has different ideas of honesty from other folks, it is not my place to question His decree.
“I reckon she never had any use for them,” I say. They
turned out real well, too. The quilt is drawn up to her chin, hot as it is, with
only her two hands and her face outside. She is propped
on the pillow, with her head raised so she can see out the
window, and we can hear him every time he takes up the
adze or the saw. If we were deaf we could almost watch
her face and hear him, see him. Her face is wasted away
so that the bones draw just under the skin in white lines. Her eyes are like two candles when you watch them
gutter down into the sockets of iron candle-sticks. But
the eternal and the everlasting salvation and grace is not
upon her. "They turned out real nice,” I say. "But not hke the
cakes Addie used to bake.” You can see that girl’s washing
and ironing in the pillow-slip, if ironed it ever was. Maybe it will reveal her blindness to her, laying there
at the mercy and the ministration of four men and a tomboy
girl. "There’s not a woman in this section could ever bake with Addie Bundren,” I say. "First thing we know
she’ll be up and baking again, and then we won’t have
AS I LAY DYING 345
any sale for ours at all.” Under the quilt she makes no more of a hump than a rail would, and the only way you
can tell she is breathing is by the sound of the mattress
shucks. Even the hair at her cheek does not move, even
with tliat girl standing right over her, fanning her with
the fan. While we watch she swaps the fan to the other
hand without stopping it. “Is she sleeping?” Kate whispers.
“She's just watching Cash yonder,” the girl says. We
can hear the saw in the board. It sounds like snoring.
Eula turns on the trunk and looks out the window. Her
necklace looks real nice with her red hat. You wouldn't
think it only cost twenty-five cents. “She ought to taken those cakes,” Kate says.
I could have used the money real well. But it's not
like they cost me anything except the baking. I can teU him that anybody is likely to make a miscue, but it's not
all of them that can get out of it without loss, I can tell him. It's not everybody can eat their mistakes, I can tell him.
Someone comes through the haU. It is Dari. He does
not look in as he passes the door. Eula watches him as he
goes on and passes from sight again toward the back.
Her hand rises and touches her beads lightly, and then
her hair. When she finds me watching her, her eyes go
blank.

A AND VERNON ARE SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH. PA IS tilting snufiE from the lid of his snuff-box into his lower
lip, holding the lip outdrawn between thumb and finger.
They look around as I cross the porch and dip the gourd
into the water bucket and drink. ‘"Where’s Jewel?” pa says. When I was a boy I first learned how much better water tastes when it has set a while in a cedar bucket. Warmish-cool, with a faint taste
like the hot July wind in cedar trees smells. It has to set at least six hours, and be drunk from a gourd. Water
should never be drunk from metal. And at night it is better still. I used to lie on the pallet
in the hall, waiting until I could hear them all asleep, so I could get up and go back to the bucket. It would be
black, the shelf black, the still surface of the water a round orifice in nothingness, where before I stirred it awake with the dipper I could see maybe a star or two
in the bucket, and maybe in the dipper a star or two
before I drank. After that I was bigger, older. Then I would wait until they all went to sleep so I could lie with
my shirt-tail up, hearing them asleep, feeling myself
without touching myself, feeling the cool silence blowing
upon my parts and wondering if Cash was yonder in the
darkness doing it too, had been doing it perhaps for the
last two years before I could have wanted to or could
have.
Pa’s feet are badly splayed, his toes cramped and bent
and warped, with no toenail at aU on his little toes, from
344
AS I LAY DYll^Q
working so hard in the wet in homemade shoes when he was a boy. Beside his chair his brogans sit. They look as though they had been hacked with a blunt axe out of pigiron.
Vernon has been to town. I have never seen him go
to town in overalls. His wife, they say. She taught school
too, once.
I fling the dipper dregs to the ground and wipe my
mouth on my sleeve. It is going to rain before morning.
Maybe before dark. ''Down to the barn,’" I say. "Harnessing
the team,”
Down there fooling with that horse. He wiU go on
through the barn, into the pasture. The horse will not be
in sight: he is up there among the pine seedlings, in the
cool. Jewel whistles, once and shrill. The horse snorts,
then Jewel sees him, glinting for a gaudy instant among
the blue shadows. Jewel whistles again; the horse comes
dropping down the slope, stiff-legged, his ears cocking
and flicking, his mis-matched eyes rolling, and fetches up
twenty feet away, broadside on, watching Jewel over his shoulder in an attitude kittenish and alert. "Come here, sir,” Jewel says. He moves. Moving that
quick his coat, bunching, tongues swirling like so many
flames. With tossing mane and tail and rolling eye the
horse makes another short curveting rush and stops again,
feet bunched, watching Jewel. Jewel walks steadily to- ward him, his hands at his sides. Save for Jewels legs
they are like two figures carved for a tableau savage in the sun. When Jewel can almost touch him, the horse stands on
fais hind legs and slashes down at Jewel. Then Jewel is enclosed by a glittering maze of hooves as by an illusion of wings; among them, beneath the upreared chest, he moves with the flashing limberness of a snake. For an
instant before the jerk comes on to his arms he sees hif
J46 as I LAY DYING
V?hole body earth-free, horizontal, whipping snakelimber,
until he finds the horse’s nostrils and touches
earth again. Then they are rigid, motionless, terrific, the
horse back-thrust on stifiEened, quivering legs, with lowered
head; Jewel with dug heels, shutting ofiE the horse’s wind with one hand, with the other patting the horse's neck in short strokes myriad and caressing, cursing the
horse with obscene ferocity.
They stand in rigid terrific hiatus, the horse trembling
and groaning. Then Jewel is on the horse s back. He
flows upward in a stooping swirl like the lash of a whip,
his body in mid-air shaped to the horse. For another
moment the horse stands spraddled, with lowered head,
before it bursts into motion. They descend the hill in a
series of spine-jolting jumps. Jewel high, leech-like on
the withers, to the fence where the horse bunches to a
scuttering halt again.
“Well,” Jewel says, “you can quit now, if vqu got
a-plenty.”
Inside the bam Jewel slides mnning to the ground
before the horse stops. The horse enters the stall. Jewel
following. Without looking back the horse kicks at him,
slamming a single hoof into the wall with a pistol-like
report. Jewel kicks him in the stomach; the horse arches
his neck back, crop-toothed; Jewel strikes him across the
face with his fist and slides on to the trough and mormts
upon it. Clinging to the hay-rack he lowers his head and
peers out across the stall tops and through the doorway.
The path is empty; from here he cannot even hear Cash
sa-wing. He reaches up and drags down hay in hurried
ftimfuls and crams it into the rack. “Eat,” he says. “Get the goddamn stuff out of sight
tvhile you got a chance, you pussel-gutted bastard. You
Iweet son of a bitch,” he says.
JEWEL
I
T^'S BECAUSE HE STAYS OUT THERE, RIGHT UNDER THE WIN^
dow, hammering and sawing on that goddamn box
Where she’s got to see him. Where every breath she draws is full of his knocking and sawing where she car
see him saying See. See what a good one I am making foi you. I told him to go somewhere else. I said Good God
do you want to see her in it. It’s like when he was a httle boy and she says if she had some fertilizer she would tr}' to raise some flowers and he taken the bread-pan and
brought it back from the barn full of dung.
And now them others sitting there, like buzzards
Waiting, fanning themselves. Because I said If you
wouldn’t keep on sawing and nailing at it until a man
can’t sleep even and her hands laying on the quilt like two of them roots dug up and tried to wash and you
couldn’t get them clean. I can see the fan and Dewey
Dell’s arm. I said if you’d just let her alone. Sawing and
knocking, and keeping the air always moving so fast on
her face that when you’re tired you can’t breathe it, and
that goddamn adze going One lick less. One lick less. One Hck less until everybody that passes in the road will have to stop and see it and say what a fine carpenter he
is. If it had just been me when Cash fell off of that church and if it had just been me when pa laid sick with
that load of wood fell on him, it would not be happening
with every bastard in the county coming in to stare at her because if there is a God what the hell is He for. It would just be me and her on a high hill and me rolling
347
34^ AS I LAY DYING
the rocks down the hill at their faces, picking them up
and throwing them down the hill, faces and teeth and all by God until she was quiet and not that goddamn adze
going One lick less. One lick less and we could be quiet.
DARL
WE WATCH HIM COME ABOUND THE CORNER AND
mount the steps. He does not look at us. "'You
ready?’' he says.
"If you’re hitched up,” I say. I say "Wait.” He stops,
looking at pa. Vernon spits, without moving. He spits
with decorous and deliberate precision into the pocked
dust below the porch. Pa rubs his hands slowly on his knees. He is gazing out beyond the crest of the bluflF, out
across the land. Jewel watches him a moment, then he
goes on to the pail and drinks again.
"I mislike undecision as much as ere a man,” pa says.
"It means three dollars,” I say. The shirt across pa’s
hump is faded Hghter than the rest of it. There is no
sweat stain on his shirt. I have never seen a sweat stain on his shirt. He was sick once from working in the sun when he was twenty-two years old, and he tells people
that if he ever sweats, he will die. I suppose he beheves
it. “But if she don’t last until you get back,” he says. “She
will be disappointed.”
AS I LAY DYING 34^
Vernon spits into the dust. But it will rain before
morning.
‘'Shes counted on it,” pa says. ‘'She'll want to start right away. I know her. I promised her I’d keep the team
here and ready, and she s counting on it.” “Well need that three dollars then, sure,” I say. He
gazes out over the land, rubbing his hands on his knees. Since he lost his teeth his mouth collapses in slow repeti- tion when he dips. The stubble gives his lower face that appearance that old dogs have. “You d better make up
your mind soon, so we can get there and get a load on
before dark,” I say. “Ma ain’t that sick,” Jewel says. “Shut up, Dari.”
“That’s right,” Vernon says. “She seems more like her^
self today than she has in a week. Time you and Jewel
get back, she’ll be setting up.”
“You ought to know,” Jewel says. “You been here often
enough looking at her. You or your folks.” Vernon looks
at him. Jewel’s eyes look lilce pale wood in his highblooded
face. He is a head taller than any of the rest of
us, always was. I told them that’s why ma always
whipped him and petted him more. Because he was peakling
around the house more. That’s why she named him
Jewel I told them.
“Shut up, Jewel,” pa says, but as though he is not
listening much. He gazes out across the land, rubbing his knees.
“You could borrow the loan of Vernon’s team and we
could catch up with you,” I say. “If she didn’t wait for
us.“Ah, shut your goddamn mouth,” Jewel says. “She’ll want to go in ourn,” pa says. He rubs his knees. “Don’t ere a man mislike it more.”
“It’s laying there, watching Cash whittle on that
550 AS I LAY DYING
damn . , Jewel says. He says it harshly, savagely,
but he does not say the word. Like a little boy in the
dark to flail his courage and suddenly aghast into silence by his own noise.
‘'She wanted that like she wants to go in our own
wagon," pa says. “Shell rest easier for knowing ifs a good one, and private. She was ever a private woman.
You know it well." “Then let it be private," Jewel says. “But how the
hell can you expect it to be He looks at the back
of pas head, his eyes like pale wooden eyes. “Sho," Vernon says, “shell hold on till it’s finished. Shell hold on till everything’s ready, till her own good
time. And with the roads like they are now, it wont
take you no time to get her to town."
“It’s fixing up to rain," pa says. “I am a luckless man.
I have ever been." He rubs his hands on his knees. “It’s that dum doctor, liable to come at any time. I couldn’t
get word to him till so late. If he was to come tomorrow
and tell her the time was nigh, she wouldn’t wait. I know
her. Wagon or no wagon, she wouldn’t wait. Then she’d
be upset, and I wouldn’t upset her for the living world.
With that family burying-ground in Jefferson and them
of her blood waiting for her there, she’ll be impatient. I promised my word me and the boys would get her there
quick as mules could walk it, so she could rest quiet."
He rubs his hands on his knees. “No man ever mishked
it more."
“If everybody wasn’t burning hell to get her there,"
Jewel says in that harsh, savage voice. “With Cash aU
day long right under the \vindow, hammering and saw«
ing at that
“It was her wish," pa says. “You got no affection nor
gentleness for her. You never had. We would be be-
AS I LAY DYING 351
holden to no man/' he says, ‘me and her. We have never
yet been, and she will rest quieter for knowing it and that
it was her own blood sawed out the boards and drove
the nails. She was ever one to clean up after herself/'
It means three dollars," I say. “Do you want us to go, or not?" Pa rubs his knees. “Well be back by to- morrow sundown."
“Well . . pa says. He looks out over the land, awry^
haii*ed, mouthing the snuff slowly against his gums.
“Come on/' Jewel says. He goes down tibe steps<
Vernon spits neatly into the dust. “By sundown, now," pa says. “I would not keep her
waiting."
Jewel glances back, then he goes on around the house.
I enter the hall, hearing the voices before I reach the
door. Tilting a little down the hill, as our house does, a breeze draws through the hall all the time, upslanting,
A feather dropped near the front door will rise and brush
along the ceiling, slanting backward, until it reaches the down-turning current at the back door: so with voices. As you enter the hall, they sound as though they were
speaking out of the air about your head.

I
T WAS THE SWEETEST THING I EVER SAW. IT WAS LIKE HE
knew he would never see her again, that Anse Bundren was driving him from his mother s death-bed, never to see her in this world again. I always said Dari was dif-
352 AS I LAY DYING
ferent from those others. I always said he was the only one of them that had his mother s nature, had any
natural affection. Not that Jewel, the one she laboured
so to bear and coddled and petted so and him flinging
into tantrums or sulking spells, inventing devilment to devil her till I would have frailed him time and dme. Not
him to come and tell her good-bye. Not him to miss a chance to make that extra three dollars at the price of
his mothers good-bye kiss. A Bundren through and
through, loving nobody, caring for nothing except how
to get something with the least amount of work. Mr.
Tull says Dari asked them to wait. He said Dari almost
begged them on his knees not to force him to leave her
in her condition. But nothing would do but Anse and
Jewel must make that three dollars. Nobody that knows
Anse could have expected different, but to think of that
boy, that Jewel, selling all those years of self-denial and
down-right partiality—^they couldn't fool me: Mr. Tull
says Mrs. Bundren liked Jewel the least of all, but I knew
better. I knew she was partial to him, to the same quality
in him that let her put up with Anse Bundren when
Mr. Tull said she ought to poisoned him—^for three dollars,
denying his dying mother the good-bye kiss. Why, for the last three weeks I have been coming
over every time I could, coming sometimes when I shouldn't have, neglecting my own family and duties so
that somebody would be with her in her last moments
and she would not have to face the Great Unknovm with- out one familiar face to give her courage. Not that I de- serve credit for it: I will expect the same for myself. But
thank God it will be the faces of my loved kin, my blood
and flesh, for in my husband and children I have been more blessed than most, trials though they have been at times.
AS I LAY DYING 3S3
She lived, a lonely woman, lonely with her pride, trying
to make folks believe different, hiding the fact that they just suffered her, because she was not cold in the
coffin before they were carting her forty miles away to bury her, flouting the will of God to do it. Refusing to
let her lie in the same earth with those Bundrens.
''But she wanted to go,’’ Mr. Tull said. "It was her
own wish to He among her own people.”
"Then why didn’t she go alive?” I said. "Not one of
them would have stopped her, with even that little one
almost old enough now to be selfish and stone-hearted
like the rest of them.”
"It was her own v^ash,” Mr. Tull said, "I heard Anse
say it was.”
"And you vould beheve Anse, of course,” I said. "A
man Hke you would. Don’t tell me.”
"I’d believe him about something he couldn’t expect
to make anything off of me by not telHng,” Mr. Tull said. "Don’t tell me,” I said. "A woman’s place is with hei
husband and children, alive or dead. Would you expect
me to want to go back to Alabama and leave you and the
girls when my time comes, that I left of my own will to cast my lot with yours for better and worse, until death
and after?” "Well, folks are different,” he said.
I should hope so. I have tried to live right in the sight
of God and man, for the honour and comfort of my
Christian husband and the love and respect of my Chris- tian children. So that when I lay me down in the consciousness
of my duty and reward I wiH be surrounded
by loving faces, carrying the farewell kiss of each of my
loved ones into my reward. Not like Addie Bundren
dying alone, hiding her pride and her broken heart. Glad
to go. Lying there with her head propped up so she could
3J4 I LAY DYING
watch Cash building the coffin, having to watch him so would not skimp on it, like as not, with those men not worrying about anything except if there was time to earn another three dollars before the rain came and the river got too high to get across it. Like as not, if they hadn't
decided to make that last load, they would have loaded
her into the wagon on a quilt and crossed the river &st
and then stopped and give her time to die what Christian
death they would let her. Except Dari. It was the sweetest thing I ever saw. Sometimes I lose faith in human nature for a time; I am
assailed by doubt. But always the Lord restores my faith and reveals to me His bounteous love for His creatures. Not Jewel, the one she had always cherished, not him.
He was after that three extra dollars. It was Dari, the one that folks say is queer, lazy, pottering about the
place no better than Anse, with Cash a good carpenter
and always more building than he can get around to, and
Jewel always doing something that made him some money or got him talked about, and that near-naked
girl always standing over Addie witli a fan so that every
time a body tried to talk to her and cheer her up, would
answer for her right quick, like she was trying to keep
anybody from coming near her at all. It was Dari. He come to the door and stood there,
looldng at his dying mother. He just looked at her, and
I felt the bounteous love of the Lord again and His
mercy. I saw that with Jewel she had just been pretending,
but that it was between her and Dari that the understanding
and the true love was. He just looked at her,
not even coming in where she could see him and get upset,
knowing that Anse was driving him away and he
would never see her again. He said nothing, just looking
at hen
I LAY DYING 355
“What you want, Dari?” Dewey Dell said, not stopping the fan, spealdng up quick, keeping even him
from her. He didnt answer. He just stood and looked at
his dying mother, his heart too full for words.

he first time me and lafe picked on down the row. Pa dassent sweat because he will catch his death
from the sickness so everybody that comes to help us. And Jewel don t care about anything he is not kin to us in caring, not care-kin. And Cash hke sawing the long hot
sad yellow days up into planks and nailing them to something. And pa thinks because neighbours will always
treat one another that way because he has always
been too busy letting neighbours do for him to find out. And I did not think that Dari would, that sits at the
supper table with his eyes gone further than the food and
the lamp, full of the land dug out of his skull and the
holes filled with distance beyond the land. We picked on down the row, the woods getting closer and closer and the secret shade, picking on into the secret shade with my sack and Lafe’s sack. Because I said will I or won 1 1 when the sack was half-full because I said if the sack is full when we get to the woods it won’t be me,
I said if it don’t mean for me to do it the sack will not be
full and I will turn up the next row but if the sack is full, I cannot help it. It will be that I had to do it all
356 AS I jlAY dying
the time and I cannot help it. And we picked on toward
the secret shade and our eyes would drown together
touching on his hands and my hands and I didn't say
anything. I said "What are you doing?” and he said "I am picking into your sack." And so it was full when we
came to the end of the row and I could not help it. And so it was because I could not help it. It was then^
and then I saw Dari and he knew. He said he knew without
the words like he told me that ma is going to die
without words, and I knew he knew because if he had
said he knew with the words I would not have beheved
that he had been there and saw us. But he said he did
know and I said "Are you going to tell pa are you going
to kill him?” without the words I said it and he said
"Why?” without the words. And that's why I can talk to him with knowing with hating because he knows.
He stands in the door, looking at her. "What you want, Dari?” I say. "She is going to die,” he says. And old turkey-buzzard
Tull coming to watch her die but I can fool them.
- "When is she going to die?” I say. "Before we get back,” he says. ^Then why are you taking Jewel?” I say, “I want him to help me load,” he says.
TULL
Antse keeps on rubbing his knees, ms overalls are
faded; on one knee a serge patch cut out of a pair of Sunday pants, wore iron-slick. "No man mislikes it more
than me/’ he says. "A fellow’s got to guess ahead now and then/’ I say. "But, come long and short, it wont be no harm done
neither way.”
"She’ll want to get started right off,” he says. "It’s far enough to Jefferson at best.” "But the roads is good now,” I say. It’s fixing to rain
tonight, too. His folks buries at New Hope, too, not three
miles away. But it’s just like him to marry a woman born
a day’s hard ride away and have her die on him.
He looks out over the land, rubbing his knees. "No
man so mislikes it,” he says. "They’ll get back in plenty of time,” I say. “I wouldn’t
worry none.”
"It means three dollars,” he says. "Might be it won’t be no need for them to rush back,
noways,” I say. "I hope it.” "She’s a-going,” he says. "Her mind is set on it.” It’s a hard life on women, for a fact. Some women. I mind
my mammy lived to be seventy and more. Worked every
day, rain or shine; never a sick day since her last chap was born until one day she kind of looked around her and

he says. We can hear Cash a-hammering and sawing
beyond the corner.
It"s true. Never a truer breath was ever breathed. “The
Lord giveth/" I say. That boy comes up the hill. He is carrying a fish nigh
long as he is. He slings it to the ground and grunts “Hah""
and spits over his shoulder hke a man. Dum nigh long
as he is. ‘"What"s that?"" I say. “A hog? Where"d you get it?"" “Down to the bridge/" he says. He turns it over, the
under-side caked over with dust where it is wet, the eye
coated over, humped under the dirt. “Are you aiming to leave it laying there?"" Anse says.
“I aim to show it to ma,"" Vardaman says. He looks
toward the door. We can hear the talking, coming out on
the draught. Cash, too, knocking and hammering at the
boards. “There’s company in there,"" he says. “Just my folks,’" I say. “They’d enjoy to see it, too.” He says nothing, watching the door. Then he looks
down at the fish laying in the dust. He turns it over with
his foot and prods at the eye-bump with his toe, gouging
at it. Anse is looking out over the land. Vardaman looks
at Anse’s face, then at the door. He turns, going toward
the comer of the house, when Anse calls him without
looking around.
“You clean that fish/" Anse says. Vardaman stops. ‘Why can’t Dewey Dell clean it?” he says. “You clean that fish,” Anse says. “Aw, pa,” Vardaman says. “You clean it,” Anse says. He don’t look around. Varda-

man comes back and picks up the fish. It slides out of
his hands, smearing wet dirt on to him, and flops down,
dii'tying itself again, gap-mouthed, goggle-eyed, hiding
into the dust like it was ashamed of being dead, like it was in a hurry to get back hid again. Vardaman cusses it. He cusses it like a grown man, standing a-straddle of it. Anse don't look around. Vardaman picks it up again. He
goes on around the house, toting it in both arms like an
armful of wood, it overlapping him on both ends, head
and tail. Burn nigh big as he is. Anse's wrists dangle out of his sleeves: I never see him
with a shirt on that looked like it was his in all my hfe. They all looked like Jewel might have give him his old
ones. Not Jewel, though. He's long-armed, even if he is spindling. Except for the lack of sweat. You could tell they ain't been nobod) else's but Anse’s that way without no mistake. His eyes look like pieces of bumt-out cinder
fixed in his face, looking out over the land. When the shadow touches the steps he says “It's five o'clock." Just as I get up Cora comes to the door and says it's time to get on. Anse reaches for his shoes. “Now, Mr.
Bundren," Cora says, “don't you get up now." He puts his shoes on, stomping into them, like he does eveiything
like he is hoping all the time he really can't do it and can
quit trying to. When we go up the hall we can hear
them clumping on the floor Hke they was iron shoes. He
comes toward the door where she is, blinking his eyes, kind of looking ahead of hisself before he sees, like he is hoping to find her setting up, in a chair maybe or maybe
sweeping, and looks into the door in that surprised way
like he looks in and finds her still in bed every time and
Dewey Dell still a-fanning her witli the fan. He stands
there, like he don't aim to move again nor nothing else

'‘Well, I reckon we better get on/’ Cora says. “I got to feed the chickens.” It’s iBxing to rain, toOc Clouds like that
don’t lie, and the cotton making every day the Lord
sends. That’ll be something else for him. Cash is still trimming at the boards. ‘Tf there’s ere a thing we can
do,” Cora says. Inse’U let us know,” I say. Anse don’t look at us. He looks around, blinking, in that surprised way, like he had wore hisself down being
surprised and was even surprised at that. If Cash just

“About that corn,” I say. I tell him again I will help

I can’t quit now.
“I aimed to get to it today,” he says. “Seems Hke I cant

“Maybe she’ll hold out till you are laid by,” I say.
“If God wills it,” he says. “Let Him comfort you,” Cora says.
If Cash just works that careful on my bam. He looks
up when we pass. “Don’t reckon I’ll get to you this week,”
he says. “
’Tain’t no rush,” I say. “Whenever you get around to

lap. It’s fixing to rain, sho.

"I don^'t know what hell do/* Cora says. T just don’t

'Toor Anse/’ I say. ‘'"She kept him at work for thirtyodd

more,” Kate says. ""Or if it ain’t her, hell get another one
before cotton-picking.”
""I reckon Cash and Daii can get married now,” Eula
says. ""That poor boy,” Cora says. "The poor little tyke.”
""What about Jewel?” Kate says. ""He can, too,” Eula says. ""Humph,” Kate says. ""I reckon he will. I reckon so. I reckon there’s more gals than one around here that don’t want to see Jewel tied dov^m. Well, they needn’t to worry.”
""Why, Kate!” Cora says. The wagon begins to rattle. "The poor little tyke,” Cora says.
It’s fixing to rain this night. Yes, sir. A rattling wagon is mighty dry weather, for a Birdsell. But that’ll be cured.
It will for a fact. ""She ought to taken them cakes after she said she

TJKN that road, and it fixing to RADSr, TOO. I can stand here and same as see it with second-sight,
a-shutting down behind them like a wall, shutting down
betwixt them and my given promise. I do the best I can, much as I can get my mind on anything, but durn tliem
boys.
A-laying there, right up to my door, where every bad
luck that comes and goes is bound to find it. I told
Addie it wasn't any luck living on a road when it come
by here, and she said, for tlie world like a woman, "Get
up and move, then.” But I told her it wasn't no luck in it, because the Lord put roads for travelling: why He laid them down flat on the earth. When He aims for something
to be always a-moving, He makes it long ways,
like a road or a horse or a wagon, but when He aims for something to stay put. He makes it up-and-down ways,
like a tree or a man. And so he never aimed for folks to
live on a road, because which gets there first, I says, the
road or the house? Did you ever know Him to set a road
down by a house? I says. No you never, I says, because
it s always men can't rest till they gets the house set where
everybody that passes in a wagon can spit in the doorway,
keeping the folks restless and wanting to get up and
go somewheres else when He aimed for them to stay put
like a tree or a stand of com. Because if He'd a aimed
for man to be always a-moving and going somewheres
else, wouldn't He a put him longways on his belly, like a snake? It stands to reason He would.

Putting it where every bad luck prowling can find it and come straight to my door, charging me taxes on top
of it. Making me pay for Cash having to get them cai*- penter notions when if it hadn’t been no road come there,
he wouldn’t a got them; falling ofF of churches and lift- ing no hand in six months and me and Addie slaving and
a-slaving, when there’s plenty of sawing on this place he
could do if he’s got to saw. And Dari, too. Talking me out of him, dum them. It ain’t that I am afraid of work; I always have fed me and
mine and kept a roof above us: it’s that they would short- hand me just because he tends to his own business, just
because he’s got his eyes full of the land all the time. I says to them, he was all right at first, with his eyes full of
the land, because the land laid up-and-down ways then;
it wasn’t till that ere road come and switched the land
around longways and his eyes still full of the land, that
they begun to threaten me out of him, tiying to short- hand me with the law.
Making me pay for it. She was well and hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road. Just laying down,
resting herself in her own bed, asking naught of none. "Are you sick, Addie?” I said. "I am not sick,” she said. "You lay you down and rest you,” I said. "I knowed
you are not sick. You’re just tired. You lay you down and
rest.” "I am not sick,” she said. "I will get up.”
"Lay still and rest,” I said. "You are just tired. You can
get up tomorrow.” And she was laying there, well and
hale as ere a woman ever were, except for that road.
"I never sent for you,” I said. 'T take you to witness I never sent for you.”

‘"She’s a-laying down,” I said. ""She’s just a little tired,
but she’ll ""Get outen here, Anse,” he said. ""Go set on the porch a
while.”
And now I got to pay for it, me without a tooth in my
head, hoping to get ahead enough so I could get my
mouth fixed where I could eat God’s own victuals as a man should, and her hale and well as ere a woman in the
land until that day. Got to pay for being put to the need
of that three dollars. Got to pay for the way for them
boys to have to go away to earn it. And now I can see same as second sight the rain shutting down betwixt us, a-coming up that road like a durn man, lilce it wasn’t ere a other house to rain on in all the living land.
I have heard men cuss their luck, and right, for they were sinful men. But I do not sav it’s a curse on me, be> cause I have done no wrong to be cussed by. I am not
religious, I reckon. But peace is my heart: I know it is. I have done things but neither better nor worse than them
that pretend otherlike, and I know that Old Marster will care for me as for ere a sparrow that falls. But it seems
hard that a man in his need could be so flouted by a road.
Vardaman comes around the house, bloody as a hog to
his knees, and that ere fish chopped up with the axe like as not, or maybe throwed away for him to lie about the
dogs et it. Well, I reckon I ain’t no call to expect no more
of him than of his mangrowed brothers. He comes
along, watching the house, quiet, and sits on the steps.
""Whew,” he says, ""I’m pure tired.” ""Go wash them hands,” I say. But couldn’t no woman
strove harder than Addie to make them right, man and
boy: I’ll say that for her.

^It was full of blood and guts as a hog/' he says. But '( just can t seem to get no heart into anything, with thii here weather sapping me, too. ‘Ta," he says, "is ma sick some more?"

H
e has been to town this week: the back of his
neck is trimmed close, with a white Hne between
hair and sunburn like a joint of white bone. He has not once looked back.
"Jewel,” I say. Back running, tunnelled between the
two sets of bobbing mule ears, the road vanishes beneath
the wagon as though it were a ribbon and the front axle were a spool. "Do you know she is going to die. Jewel?'
It takes two people to make you, and one people to
die. That’s how the world is going to end,
I said to Dewey Dell: "You want her to die so you can
get to town: is that it?” She wouldn’t say what we both
knew. "The reason you will not say it is, when you say
it, even to yourself, you will know it is true: is that it? But you know it is true now. I can almost tell you the
day when you knew it is true. Why won’t you say it, even
to yourself?” She will not say it. She just keeps on saying
Are you going to tell pa? Are you going to kill him?
‘'‘You cannot believe it is true because you cannot believe
3566 AS I LAY DYING
that Dewey Dell, Dewey Dell Bundren, could have such
bad luck: is that it?^" The sun, an hour above the horizon, is poised like a
bloody egg upon a crest of thunderheads; the hght has
turned copper: in the eye portentous, in tlie nose sulphurous,
smelling of lightning. When Peabody comes, tliey will have to use the rope. He has pussel-gutted himself
eating cold greens. With the rope they will haul him up
the path, baUoon-like up the sulphurous air, ‘‘Jewel,” I say, “do you know that Addie Bundren is going
to die? Addie Bimdren is going to die?”
PEABODY
WHEN ANSE FINALLY SENT FOR ME OF HIS OWN AGcord,
I said “He has wore her out at last.” And I
said a damn good thing and at first I would not go be- cause there might be something I could do and I would
have to haul her back, by God. I thought maybe they
have the same sort of fool ethics in heaven they have in the Medical College and that it was maybe Vernon TuU
sending for me again, getting me there in the nick of
time, as Vernon always does filings, getting the most for Anse’s money like he does for his own. But when it got
far enough into the day for me to read weather sign I knew it couldn’t have been anybody but Anse that sent. I knew that nobody but a luckless man could ever need
a doctor in the face of a cyclone. And I knew that if it
AS I LAY DYING 3^7
had finally occurred to Anse himself that he needed one,
it was already too late. When I reach tlie spring and get down and hitch the
team, the sun has gone down behind a bank of black
cloud like a top-heavy mountain range, like a load of cinders dumped over there, and there is no wind. I could
hear Cash sawing for a mile before I got there. Anse is standing at the top of the bluff above the path.
"Where’s the horse?” I say. "Jewel’s taken and gone,” he says. "Can’t nobody else ketch hit. You’ll have to walk up, I reckon.”
"Me, walk up, weighing two hundred and twenty-five
pounds?” I say. "Walk up that durn wall?” He stands
there beside a tree. Too bad the Lord made the mistake
of giving trees roots and giving the Anse Bundrens He
makes feet and legs. If He’d just swapped them, there
wouldn’t ever be a worry about this country being de- forested some day. Or any other country. "What do you
aim for me to do?” I say. "Stay here and get blowed clean
out of the county when that cloud breaks?” Even with
the horse it would take me fifteen minutes to ride up
across the pasture to the top of die ridge and reach the
house. The path looks like a crooked limb blown against
the bluff. Ajise has not been in town in twelve years. And how his mother ever got up there to bear him, he
being his mother’s son. "Vardaman’s gittin’ the rope,” he says. After a while Vardaman appears with the ploughline.
He gives the end of it to Anse and comes down the path,
uncoiling it. "You hold it tight,” I say. "1 done already wrote this
visit on to my books, so I’m going to chai'ge you just the
same, whether I get there or not.”
"I got hit,” Anse says. ""You kin come on up.”
368 AS I LAY DYING
rU be damned if I can see why I don’t quit. A mart
seventy years old, weighing two hundred and odd
pounds, being hauled up and down a damn mountain on
a rope. I reckon it s because I must reach the fifty-thousand
dollar mark of dead accounts on my books before I can quit. "What the hell does your wife mean,” I say, "taking sick on top of a durn mountain?”
"I’m right sorry,” he says. He let the rope go, just
dropped it, and he has turned toward the house. There
is a little daylight up here stiU, of the colour of sulphur
matches. The boards look like strips of sulphur. Cash
does not look back. Vernon Tull says he brings each
board up to the window for her to see it and say it is all right. The boy overtakes us. Anse looks back at him.
"Where’s the rope?” he says.
"It’s where you left it,” I say. "But never you mind that
rope. I got to get back down that bluff. I don’t atm for that storm to catch me up here. I’d blow too durn far once I got started.” The girl is standing by the bed, fanning her. When we
enter she turns her head and looks at us. She has been
dead these ten days. I suppose it’s having been a part of
Anse for so long that she cannot even make that change,
if change it be. I can remember how when I was young I believed death to be a phenomenon of the body; now
I know it to be merely a function of the mind—and that
of the minds of the ones who suffer the bereavement.
The nihilists say it is the end; the fundamentalists, the beginning;
when in reality it is no more than a single ten- ant or family moving out of a tenement or a town.
She looks at us. Only her eyes seem to move. It’s like they touch us, not with sight or sense, but like the stream
from a hose touches you, the stream at the instant of inv
pact as dissociated from the nozzle as tliough it had
AS I LAY DYING 3^9 never been there. She does not look at Anse at all. She
looks at me, then at the boy. Beneath the qnilt she is no more than a bundle of rotten sticks. "Well, Miss Addie,” I say. The girl does not stop the
fan. ""How are you, sister?'’ I say. Her head lies gaunt on
the pillow, looking at the boy. ""You picked out a fine time to get me out here and bring up a stoim.” Then I send Anse and the boy out. She watches the boy as he
leaves the room. She has not moved save her eyes. He and Anse are on the porch when I come out, the
boy sitting on the steps, Anse standing by a post, not even
leaning against it, his arms dangling, the hair pushed and
matted up on his head like a dipped rooster. He turns
his head, blinking at me.
""Why didn’t you send for me sooner?” I say.
""Hit was jest one thing and then another,” he says, ""That ere corn me and the boys was aimin’ to git up
with, and Dewey Dell a-takin good keer of her, and
folks cornin’ in, a-offerin’ to help and sich, till I jest
thought . . .” ""Damn the money,” I say. ""Did you ever hear of me
worrying a fellow before he was ready to pay?”
""Hit ain’t begrudgin’ the money,” he says. ""I jest kept
a-thinkin. . . . She’s goin, is she?” The dum Kttle tyke is sitting on the top step, looking smaller than ever in the
sulphur-coloured light. That’s the one trouble with this country: everything, weather, all, hangs on too long.
Like our rivers, our land: opaque, slow, violent; shaping
and creating the life of man in its implacable and brooding
image. ""I knowed hit,” Anse says. ""All the while I made sho. Her mind is sot on hit.” ""And a damn good thing, too,” I say. ""With a
trijfling ” He sits on the top step, small, motionless in faded overalls. When I came out he looked up at me.

then at Anse. But now he has stopped looking at us. He
just sits there. “Have you told her yit?’" Anse says. ‘What for?” I say. “What the devil for?”
“She'll know hit. I knowed that when she see you she
would know hit, same as writing. You wouldn't need to
tell her. Her mind
Behind us the girl says, “Paw.” I look at her, at her face. “You better go quick,” I say. When we enter the room she is watching the door.
She looks at me. Her eyes look like lamps blaring up just
before the oil is gone. “She wants you to go out,” the girl says. “Now, Addie,” Anse says, “when he come all the way
from Jefferson to git you well?” She watches me: I can
feel her eyes. It’s like she was shoving at me with them.
I have seen it before in women. Seen them drive from the room them coming with sympathy and pity, with actual
help, and clinging to some trifling animal to whom they
never were more than pack-horses. That’s what they mean by the love that passeth understanding: that pride,
that furious desire to hide that abject nakedness which we bring here with us, carry with us into operating
rooms, carry stubbornly and furiously with us into the
earth again, I leave the room. Beyond the porch Cash’s saw snores steadily into the board. A minute later she
calls his name, her voice harsh and strong.
“Cash,” she says; “you. Cash!”
DARL
P
A STANDS BESIDE THE BED. FROM BEHIND HIS LEG
Vardaman peers, with his round head and his eyes
round and his mouth beginning to open. She looks at pa;
all her failing life appears to drain into her eyes, urgent,
irremediable. "It’s Jewel she wants,” Dewey Dell says. "Why, Addie,” pa says, "liim and Dari went to make
one more load. They thought there was time. That you
would wait for them, and that three dollars and all . . ” He stoops, laying his hand on hers. For a while yet she
looks at him, without reproach, without anything at all, as if her eyes alone are hstening to the irrevocable ces- sation of his voice. Then she raises herself, who has not
moved in ten days. Dewey Dell leans down, trying to press her back.
"Ma,” she says; "ma.”
She is looking out the window, at Cash stooping
steadily at the board in the failing hght, labouring on to- ward darkness and into it as though the stroking of the saw illumined its own motion, board and saw engendered.
‘TTou, Cash,” she shouts, her voice harsh, strong, and
unimpaired. ‘"You, Cash!”
He looks up at the gaunt face framed by the window
in the twihght. It is a composite picture of aU time since
he was a child. He drops the saw and lifts the board for her to see, watching the window in which the face has
not moved. He drags a second plank into position and
slants the two of them into their final juxtaposition, ges- 371
57^ AS I LAY DYING
taring toward the ones yet on the ground, shaping with
his empty hand in pantomime the finished box. For a
while still she looks down at him from the composite
picture, neither with censure nor approbation. Then the
face disappears.
She lies back and turns her head without so much as glancing at pa. She looks at Vardaman; her eyes, the life in them, rushing suddenly upon them; the two flames
glare up for a steady instant. Then they go out as though someone had leaned down and blown upon them.
“Ma,” Dewey Dell says; ‘ ma!'’ Leaning above the bed,
her hands hfted a httle, the fan still moving like it has for ten days, she begins to keen. Her voice is strong, young,
tremulous and clear, rapt with its own timbre and vol- ume, the fan still moving steadily up and down, whispering
the useless air. Then she flings herself across Addle
Bundren s knees, clutching her, shaking her witlr the furious
strength of the young before sprawhng suddenly
across the handful of rotten bones that Addie Bundren
left, jarring the whole bed into a chattering sibilance of mattress shucks, her arms outflung and the fan in one hand still beating with expiring breath into the quilt.
From behind pa’s leg Vardaman peers, his mouth full open and all colour draining from his face into his mouth,
as though he has by some means fleshed his own teeth in
himself, sucking. He begins to move slowly backward
from the bed, his eyes round, his pale face fading into the
dusk like a piece of paper pasted on a failing wall, and
so out of the door. Pa leans above the bed in the twilight, his humped sil- houette partaking of that owl-hke quality of awry-feathered,
disgruntled outrage within which lurks a wisdom
too profound or too inert for even thought.
""Dum them boys,” he says.
AS I LAY DYING 371
Jewel, I say. Overhead the day drives level and grey, hiding the sun hy a Jlight of grey spears. In the rain tha mules smoke a little, splashed yellow with mud, the off one clinging in sliding lunges to the side of the road
above the ditch. The tilted lumber gleams dull yellow, - water-soaked and heavy as lead, tilted at a steep angle
into the ditch above the broken wheel; about the shat- tered spokes and about Jewels ankles a runnel of yellow
neither water nor earth swirls, curving with the yellow
road neither of earth nor water, down the hill dissolving into a streaming mass of dark green neither of earth nor sky. Jewel, I say. Cash comes to the door, carrying the saw. Pa stands
beside the bed, humped, his arms dangling. He turns his head, his shabby profile, his chin collapsing slowly as he
works the snuff against his gums.
‘'She’s gone,” Cash says. "She taken and left us,” pa says. Cash does not look at him. "How nigh are you done?” pa says. Cash does not
answer. He enters, carrying the saw. "I reckon you better
get at it,” pa says. "Youll have to do the best you can, with them boys gone off that-a-way.” Cash looks down
at her face. Pie is not listening to pa at all. He does not
approach tire bed. He stops in the middle of the floor,
the saw against his leg, his sweating arms powdered
lightly with sawdust, his face composed. "If you get in a
tight, maybe some of them’ll get here tomorrow and
help you,” pa says. "Vernon could.” Cash is not hstening.
He is looking down at her peaceful, rigid face fading intc
the dusk as though darkness were a precursor of the ulti- mate earth, until at last the face seems to float detached
upon it, lightly as the reflection of a dead leaf. "There is Christians enough to help you,” pa says. Cash is not lis- tening. After a while he turns without looking at pa and
374 AS I LAY DYING
leaves the room. Then the saw begins to snore again.
""They will help ns in our sorrow/’ pa says. The sound of the saw is steady, competent, unhurried,
stirring the dying light so that at each stroke her face seems to wake a little into an expression of listening and
of waiting, as though she were counting the strokes. Pa
looks down at the face, at the black sprawl of Dewey
Dell’s hair, the outflung arms, the clutched fan now motionless
on the fading quilt. '1 reckon you better get
supper on,” he says. Dewey Dell does not move.
‘‘Git up, now, and put supper on,” pa says. ‘We got to keep our strength up. I reckon Doctor Peabody’s right
hungry, coming all this way. And Cash’ll need to eat quick and get back to work so he can finish it in time.”
Dewey Dell rises, heaving to her feet. She looks down
at the face. It is like a casting of fading bronze upon the
pillow, the hands alone still with any semblance of life: a cmded, gnarled inertness; a spent yet alert quality from
which weariness, exhaustion, travail has not yet departed,
as though they doubted even yet the actuality of rest, guarding with horned and penurious alertness the cessation
which they know cannot last. Dewey Dell stoops and slides the quilt from beneath
them and draws it up over them to the chin, smoothing it down, drawing it smooth. Then without looking at pa
.she goes around the bed and leaves the room. She will go out where Peabody is^ where she can stand
in the twilight and look at his back with such an expression
that, feeling her eyes and turning, he will say; I would not let it grieve me, now. She was old, and sick
too. Suffering more than we knew. She couldnt have got
well. Vardamans getting big now, and with you to take
good care of them, all. I would try not to let it grieve
AS I luAY DYING 375 me. I expect youd better go and get some supper ready,
It dont have to he much. But theyll need to eat, and
she looking at him, saying You could do so much for me
if you just would. If you just knew. I am I and you are you and I know it and you dont know it and you coidd
do so much for me if you just would and if you just
would then 1 could tell you and then nobody would
have to know it except you and me and Dari.
Pa stands over tlie bed, dangle-amied, humped, mO'
tionless. He raises his hand to his head, scouring his hair,
listening to the saw. He comes nearer and rubs his hand,
palm and back, on his thigh and lays it on her face and
tlien on the hump of quilt where her hands are. He
touches the quilt as he saw Dewey Dell do, trying to smooth it up to the chin, but disarranging it instead. He
tries to smooth it again, clumsily, his hand awkward as a claw, smoothing at the wrinkles which he made and
which continue to emerge beneath his hand with perverse
ubiquity, so that at last he desists, his hand falling to his side and sticking itself again, palm and back, on his
tliigh. The sound of the saw snores steadily into the room. Pa breathes with a quiet, rasping sound, mouthing
the snuff against his gums. "‘God's v^ll be done," he
says. "Now I can get them teeth." Jewels hat droops limp about his neck, channelling
water on to the soaked tow-sack tied about his shoulders
as, ankle-deep in the running ditch, he piles with a slipping
two-by-jour, with a piece of rotting log for fulcrum,
at the axle. Jewel, I say, she is dead. Jewel. Addie Bundren
is dead.

And now she is getting so far ahead I cannot catch her. The ti-ees look Kke chickens when they ruffle out into

but he came and did it. ^The fat son of a bitch.” I jump from the porch, running. The top of the barn comes swooping up out of the twilight. If I jump I can
go through it like the pink lady in the circus, into the
warm smelling, without having to wait. My hands grab
at the bushes; beneath my feet the rocks and dirt go rubbling
down.
Then I can breathe again, in the warm smelling. I enter
the stall, trying to touch him, and then I can cry
then I vomit the crying. As soon as he gets through kick- ing I can and then I can cry, the crying can. "He kilt her. He kilt her.” The Life in him runs under the skin, under my hand,
running through the splotches, smelling up into my nose where the sickness is begmning to cry, vomiting the cry- 37^
:AS I LAY DYING 37r
ing, and then I can breathe, vomiting it. It makes a lot of noise. I can smell the life running up from under my
hands, up my arms, and then I can leave the stall. I cannot find it. In the dark, along the dust, the walls
I cannot find it. The crying makes a lot of noise. I wish
it wouldn’t make so much noise. Then I find it in the
wagon-shed, in the dust, and I run across the lot and into the road, the stick jouncing on my shoulder.
They watch me as I run up, beginning to jerk back,
their eyes rolling, snorting, jerking back on the hitch
rein. I strike. I can hear the stick striking; I can see it hit- ting their heads, the breast-yoke, missing altogether sometimes
as they rear and plunge, but I am glad. ""You kilt my maw!”
The stick breaks, they rearing and snorting, their feet popping loud on the ground; loud because it is going to
rain and the air is empty for the rain. But it is still long
enough. I run this way and that as they rear and jerk at the hitch-rein, striking. ''You kilt her!”
I strike at them, striking, they wheeling in a long lunge,
the buggy wheeling on to two wheels and motioiiless like
it is nailed to the ground and the horses motionless hke
they are nailed by the hind feet to the centre of a whirling-plate.
I run in the dust. I cannot see, running in the sucking
dust where the buggy vanishes tilted on two wheels. I
strike, the stick hitting into the ground, bouncing, strik- ing into the dust and then into the air again and the dusf
sucking on down the road faster than if a car was in it
And then I can cry, looking at tlie stick. It is broken
down to my hand, not longer than stove wood that was
a long stick. I throw it away and I can cry. It does ncz'^ make so much noise now.
378 AS I LAY DYING
The cow is standing in the barn door, chewing. When
she sees me come into the lot she lows, her mouth full of
flopping green, her tongue flopping.
“1 ain't a-goin’ to milk you. I ain't a-goin' to do nothing
for tlrem.” I hear her turn when I pass. When I turn she is just behind
me with her sweet, hot, hard breath.
‘'Didn't I tell you I wouldn’t?"
She nudges me, snuffing. She moans deep inside, her
mouth closed. I jerk my hand, cursing her like Jewel does.
“Git, now."
I stoop my hand to the ground and run at her. She
jumps back and whirls away and stops, watching me.
She moans. She goes on to the path and stands there,
looldng up the path.
It is dark in the barn, warm, smelling, silent. I can cry
quietly, watching the top of the liill. Cash comes to the hill, limping where he fell off of the
church. He looks down at the spring, then up the road
and back toward the barn. He comes down the path
stiffly and looks at the broken hitch-rein and at the dust
in the road and then up the road, where the dust is gone.
“I hope they’ve got clean past Tull's by now. I so hope
bit." Cash turns and limps up die path.
“Dum him. I showed him. Dum him."
I am not crying now. I am not anything. Dewey Dell comes to the hill and calls me. “Vardaman." I am not anything.
I am quiet. “You, Vardaman." I can cry quiet now,
feeling and hearing my tears. “Then hit want. Hit hadn't happened then. Hit was
a-layin' right there on the ground. And now she's gittin
ready to cook hit.” It is dark. I can hear wood, silence: I know them. But
AS I LAY DYING 379
not living sounds, not even him. It is as though the dark were resolving him out of his integrity, into an unrelated
scattering of components—snuflSngs and stampings;
smells of cooling flesh and ammoniac haii*; an illusion of a coordinated whole of splotched hide and strong bones
within which, detached and secret and familiar, an is different from my is. I see him dissolve—^legs, a rolling eye, a gaudy splotching like cold flames—and float upon
the dark in fading solution; all one yet neither; all either
yet none. I can see hearing coil toward him, caressing,
shaping his hard shape—^fetlock, hip, shoulder and head;
smell and sound. I am not afraid. “Cooked and et. Cooked and et.'’ DEWEY DELL
COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ME IF HE JUST WOUID. HE
could do everything for me. It's like everything in
the world for me is inside a tub full of guts, so that you
wonder how tliere can be any room in it for anything
else very important. He is a big tub of guts and I am a
little tub of guts and if there is not any room for anything
else important in a big tub of guts, how can it be room
in a little tub of guts. But I know it is there because God
gave women a sign when something has happened bad,
It's because I am alone. If I could just feel it, it would
be different, because I would not be alone. But if I were
not alone, everybody would know it. And he could
;So AS I LAY DYING
Jo SO much for me, and then I would not be alone. Then
I could be all right alone.
I would let him come in between me and Lafe, like Dari came in between me and Lafe, and so Lafe is alone
too. He is Lafe and I am Dewey Dell, and when mother
died I had to go beyond and outside of me and Lafe and
Dari to grieve because he could do so much for me and
he doht know it. He don’t even know it. From the back porch I cannot see the barn. Then the
sound of Cash’s sawing comes in from that way. It is like a dog outside the house, going back and forth
around the house to whatever door you come to, waiting
to come in. He said I worry more than you do and I said
You don’t know what worry is so I can’t worry. I tiy to but I can’t think long enough to worry.
I light the kitchen lamp. The fish, cut into jagged
pieces, bleeds quietly in the pan. I put it into the cupboard
quick, listening into the hall, hearing. It took her
ten days to die; maybe she don’t know it is yet. Maybe
she won’t go until Cash. Or maybe until Jewel. I take the
dish of greens from the cupboard and the bread-pan
from the cold stove, and I stop, watching the door. "Where’s Vardaman?” Cash says. In the lamp his sawdusted
arms look like sand.
don’t know. I ain’t seen him.”
""Peabody’s team run away. See if you can find Varda- man. The horse will let him catch him.”
"Well. Tell them to come to supper.”
I cannot see the barn. I said, I don’t know how to
worry. I don’t know how to cry. I tried, but I can’t. After a while the sound of the saw comes around, coming dark
along the ground in die dust-dark. Then I can see him,
going up and down above the plank.
""You come in to supper,” I say. ""Tell him.” He could
AS I LAY DYING 381
do everything for me. And he dont know it. He is his guts and I am my guts. And I am Lafe’s guts. That's it
I don't see why he didn't stay in town. We are country
people not as good as town people. I don't see why he
didn't. Then I can see the top of the barn. The cow
stands at the foot of the path, lowing. When I turn back,
Cash is gone.
I cany the buttermilk in. Pa and Cash and he are at the table. ^Where’s that big fish Bud caught, sister?” he says. I set the milk on the table. '1 never had no time to cook it.” ^Tlain turnip greens is mighty spindling eating for a man my size,” he says. Cash is eating. About his head
the print of his hat is sweated into his hair. His shirt is blotched with sweat. He has not washed his hands and
arms.
"TTou ought to took time,” pa says. 'Where's Vardaman?”
I go toward the door. "I can't find him.”
"Here, sister,” he says; "never mind about the fish. It^^I save, I reckon. Come on and sit down.”
"I ain't minding it,” I say. "I'm going to milk before ii sets in to rain.” Pa helps himself and pushes the dish on. But he does
not begin to eat. His hands are half-closed on either side of his plate, his head bowed a little, his awry hair stand- ing into the lamplight. He looks like right after the maul
hits the steer and it no longer alive and don't yet know
that it is dead.
But Cash is eating, and he is too. "You better eat something,” he says. He is looking at pa. "Like Cash and
me. You'll need it.” "Ay,” pa says. He rouses up, hke a steer that's been
382 AS I LAY dying
kneeling in a pond and you run at it. ''She would not begrudge
me it.” When I am out of sight of the house, I go fast. The cow lows at the foot of the bluff. She nuzzles at me, snuffing,
blowing her breath in a sweet, hot blast, through my
dress, against my hot nakedness, moaning. “You got to wait a little while. Then Til tend to you.” She follows me
into the barn where I set the bucket down. She breathes
into the bucket, moaning. "I told you. You just got to
wait, now. I got more to do than I can tend to.” The bam
is dark. When I pass, he kicks the wall a single blow. I go
on. The broken plank is like a pale plank standing on
end. Then I can see the slope, feel the air moving on my
face again, slow, pale, with lesser dark and with empty
seeing, the pine clumps blotched up the tilted slope, secret and waiting.
The cow in silhouette against the door nuzzles at the
silhouette of the bucket, moaning.
Then I pass the stall. I have almost passed it. I listen to it saying for a long time before it can say the word
and the hstening part is afraid tliat there may not be
time to say it. I feel my body, my bones and flesh beginning
to part and open upon the alone, and the process of coming unalone is terrible. Lafe. Lafe. "Lafe” Lafe. Lafe.
I lean a httle forward, one foot advanced with dead
walking. I feel the darkness mshing past my breast, past
the cow; I begin to msh upon the darkness but the cow
stops me and the darkness rushes on upon the sweet
blast of her moaning breath, fiiUed with wood and with
silence. "Vardaman. You, Vardaman.”
He comes out of the stall. “You dum little sneak! You
dum little sneak!”
AS I LAY DYING 3^3
He does not resist; the last of rushing darkness flees whistling away. 'What? I ain’t done nothing.”
"You durn little sneak!” My hands shake him, hard.
Maybe I couldn’t stop them. I didn’t know they could
shake so hard. They shake both of us, shaking.
"I never done it,” he says. "I never touched tlieni.” My hands stop shaldng him, but I still hold him.
'What are you doing here? Why didn’t you answer when
I called you?”
"I ain’t doing nothing.”
"You go on to tlie house and get your suppei\”
He draws back. I hold him. "You quit now. You leave
me be.” 'What were you doing down here? You didn’t come down here to sneak after me?”
"I never. I never. You quit, now. I didn’t even know
you was down here. You leave me be.”
I hold him, leaning down to see his face, feel it with
my eyes. He is about to ciy. "Go on, now. I done put
supper on and I’ll be there soon as I milk. You better go on before he eats everything up. I hope that team runs' clean back to Jefferson.” "He kilt her,” he says. He begins to cry. "Hush.”
"She never hurt him and he come and kilt her.” "Hush.” He struggles. I hold him. "Hush.”
"He kilt her.” The cow comes up behind us, moaning.
I shake him again.
"You stop it, now. Right this minute. You’re fixing to make yourself sick and then you can’t go to town. You
go on to tlie house and eat yom* supper.”
"I don’t want no supper. I don’t want to go to town.”
'We’ll leave you here, then. Lessen you behave, we wiU
384 AS I LAY DYING
leave you. Go on, now, before that old green-eating tub
of guts eats everything up from you.” He goes on, disappearing
slowly into the hill. The crest, the trees, the roof
of the house stand against the sky. The cow nuzzles at me, moaning. "Youll just have to wait. What you got in you ain’t nothing to what I got in me, even if you are a woman too.” She follows me, moaning. Then the dead,
hot, pale air breathes on my face again. He could fix it all right, if he just would. And he don’t even know it. He
could do everything for me if he just Imowed it. The cow
breathes upon my hips and back, her breath warm,
sweet, stertorous, moaning. The sky lies flat down the
slope, upon the secret clumps. Beyond the hill sheet- lightning stains upward and fades. The dead air shapes
the dead earth in the dead darkness, further away than
seeing shapes the dead earth. It lies dead and warm
upon me, touching me naked through my clothes. I said
You don’t know what worry is. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know whether I am worrying or not. Whether I can or not. I don’t know whether I can cry or not. I don’t
know whether I have tried to or not. I feel like a wet
seed wild in the hot blind earth. VARDAMAN
WHEN THEY GET IT FINISHED THEY ABE GOING TO PUT
her in it and then for a long time I couldn’t say it. I saw the dark stand up and go whirling away and I said
*‘Axe you going to nail her up in it, Cash? Cash? Cash?” I
AS I LAY DYIISTG 3S5
got shut up in the crib the new door it was too heavy
for me it went shut I couldn’t breathe because the rat was breathing up all the air. I said "Are you going to nail
it shut, Cash? Nail it? Nail it?” Pa walks around. His shadow walks around, over Cash
going up and down above the saw, at the bleeding
plank.
Dewey Dell said we will get some bananas. The train
is behind the glass, red on the track. When it runs the
track shines on and ofiF. Pa said flour and sugar and coffee
costs so much. Because I am a country boy because boys
in town. Bicycles. Why do flour and sugar and coffee cost so much when he is a country boy. "Wouldn’t you ruther
have some bananas instead?” Bananas are gone, eaten,
Gone. When it runs on the track shines again. "Why ain’t I a town boy, pa?” I said God made me. I did not said
to God to made me in the country. If He can make the
train, why can’t He make them all in the town because
flour and sugar and coffee. "Wouldn’t you ruther have
bananas?”
He walks around. His shadow walks around.
It was not her. I was there, looking. I saw. I thought
it was her, but it was not. It was not my mother. She
went away when the other one laid down in her bed and
drew the quilt up. She went away. "Did she go as far as town?” "She went farther than town.” "Did all those rabbits
and possums go farther than town?” God made the
rabbits and possums. He made the train. Why must He
make a different place for tliem to go if she is just like the
rabbit. Pa walks around. His shadow does. The saw sounds
like it is asleep.
And so if Cash nails the box up, she is not a rabbit,
and so if she is not a rabbit I couldn’t breathe in the
386 AS I LAY DYING
crib and Cash is going to nail it up. And so if she lets him it is not her. I know. I was there. I saw when it did
not be her. I saw. They think it is and Cash is going to nail it up.
It was not her because it was laying right yonder in the dirt. And now its all chopped up. I chopped it up.
It’s laying in the kitchen in the bleeding pan, waiting to be cooked and et. Then it wasn’t and she was, and now
it is and she wasn’t. And tomorrow it will be cooked and
et and she will be him and pa and Cash and Dewey Dell
and there won’t be anything in the box and so she can
breathe. It was laying right yonder on the ground. I can
get Vernon. He was there and he seen it, and with both
of us it will be and then it will not be. TULL
I
T WAS NIGH TO MIDNIGHT AND IT HAD SET IN TO RAIN
when he woke us. It had been a misdoubtful night,
with the storm making; a night when a fellow looks for most anything to happen before he can get the stock fed
and himself to the house an supper et and in bed with the
rain starting, and when Peabody’s team come up, lath- ered, with the broke harness dragging and the neck-yoke
betwixt the oiff critter’s legs, Cora says ‘It’s Addie Bundren.
She’s gone at last.” TPeabody mought have been to ere a one of a dozen
houses hereabouts,” I says. “Besides, how do you know
it’s Peabody’s team?”
AS I LAY DYING 387
"Well, amt it?” she says. Wou hitch up, now.’^ "What for?” I says. "If she is gone, we can’t do nothing
till moiiiing. And it fixing to storm too.
"It’s my duty,” she says. ""You put the team in.” But I wouldn’t do it. ""It stands to reason they’d send
for us if they needed us. You don’t even know she’s gone
yet.
"Why, don’t you know that’s Peabody’s team? Do you
^ claim it ain’t? Well, tlien.” But I wouldn’t go. When folks wants a fellow, it’s best to wait till they sends for him,
I’ve found. ""It’s my Christian duty,” Cora says. ""Will you stand between me and my Christian duty?”
""You can stay there all day tomorrow, if you want,” I
says. So when Cora waked me it had set in to rain. Even
while I was going to the door with the lamp and it shin- ing on the glass so he could see I am coming, it kept on
knocking. Not loud, but steady, like he might have gone
to sleep thumping, but I never noticed how low down
on the door the knocking was till I opened it and never
seen nothing. I held the lamp up, with the rain sparkling
across it and Cora back in the hall saying ""Who is it, Vernon?”
but I couldn’t see nobody a-taU at first until I looked down and around the door, lowering the lamp.
He looked like a drowned puppy, in them overalls,
without no hat, splashed up to his knees where he had
walked them four miles in the mud. ""Well, I’ll be
durned,” I says. ""Who is it, -Vernon?” Cora says. He looked at me, his eyes round and black in tlie mid^
die like when you throw a light in a owl’s face. ""You mind that ere fish,” he says. ""Come in the house,” I says. ""What is it? Is your
naw ”
388 AS I LAY DYING
''Vernon/" Cora says. He stood kind of around behind the door, in the dark. The rain was blowing on to the lamp, hissing on it so I am scared every minute itll break. "You was there,'' he
says. "You seen it.” Then Cora come to the door. "You come right in outen
the rain,” she says, pulling him in and him watching me. He looked just like a drowned puppy. "I told you,” Cora
says. "I told you it was a-happening. You go and hitch.” "But he am t said I says. He looked at me, dripping on to the floor. "He’s a-ruin- ing the rug,” Cora says. "You go get the team while I take
him to the kitchen.”
But he hung back, dripping, watching me with them
eyes. "You was there. You seen it laying there. Cash is fixing to nail her up, and it was a-laying right there on
the ground. You seen it You seen the mark in the dirt. The rain never come up till after I was a-coming here. So
we can get back in time.”
I be durn if it didn’t give me the creeps, even when I didn’t know yet. But Cora did. "You get that team quick
as you can,” she says. "He’s outen his head with grief and
worry.”
I be durn if it didn’t give me the creeps. Now and
then a fellow gets to thinking. About all the sorrow and
afflictions in this world; how it’s hable to strike anywhere,
like lightning. I reckon it does take a powerful
trust in the Lord to guard a fellow, though sometimes I think that Cora’s a mite over-cautious, like she was tiying
to crowd the other folks away and get in closer than anybody
else. But then, when something like this happens,
I reckon she is right and you got to keep after it and I reckon I am blessed in having a wife that ever strives for
sanctity and well-doing like she says I am.
AS I LAY DYING 389
Now and then a fellow gets to thinking about it. Not
often, though. Which is a good thing. For the Lord
aimed for him to do and not to spend too much time
thinking, because his brain ifs like a piece of machinery;
it won't stand a whole lot of racking. It's best when
it all runs along the same, doing the day's work and not no one part used no more than needful. I have said and
I say again, that's ever living thing the matter with Dari:
he just thinks by himself too much. Cora's right when
she says all he needs is a wife to straighten him out And
when I think about that, I tliink that if nothing but be- ing married will help a man, he's durn nigh hopeless. But
I reckon Cora's right when she says the reason the Lord
had to create women is because man don't know his own
good when he sees it. Wlien I come back to the house with the team, they was in the kitchen. She was dressed on top of her nightgown
with a shawl over her head and her umbrella and
her Bible wrapped up in the oilcloth, and him sitting on
a up-turned bucket on the stove-zinc where she had put
him, dripping on to the floor. “I can't get nothing outen
him except about a fish," she says. ‘It's a judgment on
them. I see tlie hand of the Lord upon this boy for Anse
Bundren s judgment and warning."
''The rain never come up till after I left," he says. "I had done left. I was on the way. And so it was there in
the dust. You seen it. Cash is fixing to nail her, but you
seen it." When we got there is was raining hard, and him sitting on the seat between us, wrapped up in Cora's shawl. He
hadn't said nothing else, just sitting there with Cora holding
the umbrella over him. Now and then Cora would
stop singing long enough to say "It’s a judgment on Anse
Bundren. May it show him the path of sin he is a-trocL
390 AS I LAY DYING
ding/’ Then she would sing again, and him sitting there
between us, leaning forward a little like the mules
couldn’t go fast enough to suit liim.
‘Tt was laying right yonder,” he says, ‘l^ut the rain come up after I taken and left. So I can go and open
the windows, because Cash ain’t nailed her yet.”
It was long a-past midnight when we drove the last
nail, and almost dust-dawn when I got back home and
taken the team out and got back in bed, with Cora’s
nightcap laying on the other pillow. And be durned if even then it wasn’t like I could still hear Cora singing
and feel that boy leaning forward between us like he was
ahead of the mules, and still see Cash going up and
down with that saw, and Anse standing there hke a scare- crow, like he was a steer standing knee-deep in a pond
and somebody come by and set the pond up on edge
and he ain’t missed it yet.
It was nigh toward daybreak when we drove the last nail and toted it into the house, where she was laying on
the bed with the window open and the rain blowing on
her again. Twice he did it, and him so dead for sleep
that Cora says his face looked like one of these here
Christmas masts that had done been buried a while and
then dug up, until at last they put her into it and nailed
it down so he couldn’t open the window on her no more. And the next morning they found him in his shirt-tail laying asleep on the floor like a felled steer, and the top
of the box bored clean full of holes and Cash’s new auger
broke off in the last one. When they taken the lid off her
they found that two of them had bored on into her face.
If it’s a judgment, it ain’t right. Because the Lord’s
got more to do than that. He’s bound to have. Because
the only burden Anse Bundren’s ever had is himself. And
AS I LAY DYING 391
when folks talks him low, I think to myself he ain t that
less of a man or he couldn’t a bore himself this long.
It ain’t right. I be durn if it is. Because He said Suffer
little children to come unto Me don’t make it right, neither. Cora said, "1 have bore you what the Lord God
sent me. I faced it without fear nor terror because my
faith was strong in the Lord, a-bolstering and sustaining me. If you have no son, it’s because the Lord has decreed
otherwise in His wisdom. And my hfe is and has ever been a open book to ere a man or v^oman among His
creatures because I trust in my God and my reward.”
I reckon she’s right. I reckon if there’s ere a man or woman anywhere that He could turn it all over to and ga
away witli His mind at rest, it would be Cora. And I reckon she would make a few changes, no matter how He
was running it. And I reckon they would be for man’s
good. Leastways, we would have to like them. Leastways,
we might as well go on and make like we did. DARL
T
he lantern sits on a stump, busted, grease-fouled,
its cracked chimney smeared on one side with a soar- ing smudge of soot, it sheds a feeble and sultry glare
upon the trestles and the boards and the adjacent earth. Upon the dark ground the chips look like random smears
of soft pale paint on a black canvas. The boards look
39^ AS I LAY DYING
like long smooth tatters torn from the flat darkness and
turned backside out. Cash labours about the trestles, moving back and
forth, lifting and placing the planks with long clattering
reverberations in the dead air as though he were lifting
and dropping them at tlie bottom of an invisible well,
the sounds ceasing without departing, as if any move- ment might dislodge them from the immediate air in reverberant repetition. He saws again, his elbow flashing
slowly, a thin thread of fire running along the edge of the saw, lost and recovered at the top and bottom of each stroke in unbroken elongation, so that the saw appears
to be six feet long, into and out of pa’s shabby and
aimless silhouette. ''Give me that plank,” Cash says. "No;
the other one.” He puts the saw down and comes and
picks up the plank he wants, sweeping pa away with
the long swinging gleam of tlie balanced board.
The air smells like sulphur. Upon the impalpable
plane of it their shadows form as upon a wall, as though
like sound they had not gone very far away in falling
but had merely congealed for a moment, immediate and
musing. Cash works on, half turned into the feeble hght, one thigh and one pole-thin arm braced, his face sloped
into the light with a rapt, dynamic immobility above
his tireless elbow. Below the sky sheet-lightning slumbers
lightly; against it the trees, motionless, are ruflS'ed out to the last twig, swollen, increased as though quick
with young.
It begins to rain. The first harsh, sparse, swift drops
rush through the leaves and across the ground in a long
sigh, as though of relief from intolerable suspense. They
are big as buckshot, warm as though fired from a gun;
they sweep across the lantern in a vicious hissing. Pa
lifts his face, slack-mouthed, the wet black rim of snuff
AS I LAY DYING 393
plastered close along the base of his gums; from behind
his slack-faced astonishment he muses as though from
beyond time, upon the ultimate outrage. Cash looks once
at the sky, then at the lantern. The saw has not falteredj
the running gleam of its pistoning edge unbroken. “Get
something to cover the lantern,” he says. Pa goes to the house. The rain rushes suddenly down,
without thunder, without warning of any sort; he is swept on to the porch upon the edge of it and in an
instant Cash is wet to the skin. Yet the motion of the saw has not faltered, as though it and the ann functioned
in a tranquil conviction that rain was an illusion of the
mind. Then he puts down the saw and goes and crouches
above the lantern, shielding it with his body, his back
shaped lean and scrawny by his wet shirt as though he
had been abruptly turned wrong-side out, shirt and all. Pa returns. He is wearing Jewel’s raincoat and carrying
Dewey Dell’s. Squatting over the lantern, Cash reaches
back and picks up four sticks and drives them into the
earth and takes Dewey Dells raincoat from pa and
spreads it over the sticks, forming a roof above the lantern.
Pa watches him. '1 don’t know what you’ll do,” he
says. '"Dari taken his coat with him.”
"Get wet,” Cash says. He takes up the saw again;
again it moves up and down, in and out of that unhurried
imperviousness as a piston moves in the oil; soaked,
scrawny, tireless, with the lean light body of a boy ot an old man. Pa watches him, blinking, his face streaming;
again he looks up at the sky vdth that expression
of dumb and brooding outrage and yet of vindication,
as though he had expected no less; now and then he
stirs, moves, gaunt and streaming, picking up a board

and Vemon are hunting the saw. After a while they find
it in pa's hand.
'Why don't you go on to the house, out of the rain?"
Cash says. Pa looks at liim, his face streaming slowly.
It is as though upon a face carved by a savage caricaturist
a monstrous burlesque of all bereavement flowed.
"You go on in," Cash says. "Me and Vernon can finish
It. Pa looks at them. The sleeves of Jewel's coat are too
short for him. Upon his face the rain streams, slow as cold glycerine. "I don't begrudge her the wetting," he
says. He moves again and falls to shifting the planks,
picldng them up, laying them down again carefully, as though they are glass. He goes to the lantern and pulls
at the propped raincoat until he knocks it down and
Cash comes and fixes it back.
"You get on to tlie house,” Cash says. He leads pa
to the house and returns with the raincoat and folds it and places it beneath the shelter where the lantern sits Vernon has not stopped. He looks up, still sawing.
‘'You ought to done that at first,” he says. "You knowed
it was fixing to rain.”
"It's his fever," Cash says. He looks at the board.
"Ay," Vernon says. "He’d a come, anyway."
Cash squints at the board. On the long flank of it the
rain crashes steadily, myriad, fluctuant. "I’m going to bevel it,” he says.
"It'll take more time,” Vemon says. Cash sets the
piank on edge; a moment longer Vemon watches him,
then he hands him the plane.
Vemon holds the board steady while Cash bevels the
edge of it with the tedious and minute care of a jeweller.
Mrs. Tull comes to the edge of the porch and calls Vernon. "How near are you done?” she says.
AS I LAY DYING 39S
Vernon does not look up. ‘‘Not long. Some, yet.”
She watches Cash stooping at the plank, the turgid
savage gleam of the lantern slicking on the raincoat as he moves. “You go down and get some planks off the
bam and finish it and come in out of the rain,” she says. “Youll both catch your deatli.” Vernon does not move.
“Vernon,” she says. “We wont be long,” he says. “We’ll be done after a
spell.” Mrs. Tull watches them a while. Then she re- enters the house.
“If we get in a tight, we could take some of them
planks,” Vernon says. ‘Til help you put them back.”
Cash ceases the plane and squints along the plank,
wiping it with his palm. “Give me the next one,” he
says. Some time toward dawn the rain ceases. But it is not
yet day when Cash drives the last nail and stands stiffly
up and looks down at the finished coflBn, the others
watching him. In the lantern-light his face is calm, musing;
slowly he strokes his hands on his raincoat thighs
in a gesture deliberate, final and composed. Then the
four of them—Cash and pa and Vernon and Peabody —raise the coflBn to their shoulders and turn toward the
house. It is light, yet they move slowly; empty, yet they
carry it carefully; lifeless, yet they move with hushed
precautionary words to one another, speaking of it as though, complete, it now slumbered lightly alive, waiting
to come awake. On the dark floor their feet clump
awkwardly, as though for a long time they have not
walked on floors. They set it down by the bed. Peabody says quietly: ‘Let s eat a snack. It’s almost daylight. Where’s Cash?’' He has returned to the trestles, stooped again in the
lantern’s feeble glare as he gathers up his tools and
396 AS I LAY DYI]SG
wipes them on a cloth carefully and puts them into the
box with its leather sling to go over the shoulder. Then
he takes up box, lantern and raincoat and returns to the
house, mounting the steps into faint silhouette against
the paling east. In a strange room you must empty yourself for sleep.
And before you are emptied for sleep, what are you.
And when you are emptied for sleep, you are not. And
when you are filled with sleep, you never were. I don’t
know what I am. I don’t know if I am or not. Jewel
knows he is, because he does not know that he does not know whether he is or not. He cannot empty himself
for sleep because he is not what he is and he is what
he is not. Beyond the unlamped wall I can hear the
rain shaping the wagon that is ours, the load that is no longer theirs that felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either, lie on our wagon tliough it does, since only the wind and the rain
shape it only to Jewel and me, that are not asleep. And
since sleep is is-not and rain and wind are it is not. Yet the wagon is, because when the wagon is was, Addie
Bundren will not be. And Jewel is, so Addie Bundren
must be. And then I must be, or I could not empty myself
for sleep in a strange room. And so if I am not emptied yet, I am is. How often have I lain beneath rain on a strange roof,
thinking of home.

T WAS TEN o’clock WHEN I GOT BACK, WITH PEABODY’s
team hitched on to the back of the wagon. They had
already dragged the buckboard back from where Quick
found it upside down straddle of the ditch about a mile
from the spring. It was pulled out of the road at the
spring, and about a dozen wagons was already there.
It was Quick found it. He said the river was up and still rising. He said it had already covered the highest watermark
on the bridge-piling he had ever seen. “That bridge
won’t stand a whole lot of water,” I said. “Has somebody
told Anse about it?” “I told him,” Quick said. “He says he reckons them
boys has heard and unloaded and are on the way back
by now. He says they can load up and get across.” “He better go on and bury her at New Hope,” Armstid
said. “That bridge is old. I wouldn’t monkey with
it.” ^ 335
AS I LAY DYING 39^
‘"His mind is set on taking her to JeJBferson,” Quick
said. “Then he better get at it soon as he can/" Armstid
said. Anse meets us at the door. He has shaved, but not
good. There is a long cut on his jaw, and he is wearing
liis Sunday pants and a white shirt with the neckband
buttoned. It is drawn smooth over his hump, making it look bigger than ever, like a white shirt will, and his face is diflFerent too. He looks foUcs in the eye now, dignified,
his face tragic and composed, shaking us by the
hand as we walk up on to the porch and scrape oirr shoes, a Httle stiff in our Sunday clothes, our Sunday
clothes rustling, not looking full at him as he meets us. 'The Lord giveth,"" we say. 'The Lord giveth/"
That boy is not there. Peabody told about how he come into the kitchen, hollering, swarming and clawing
at Cora when he found her cooking that fish, and
how Dewey Dell taken him down to the barn. "My
team all right?” Peabody says. "All right,” I tell him. "I give them a bait this morning.
Your buggy seems aU right too. It ain’t hurt.” "And no fault of somebody’s,” he says. "I’d give a
nickel to know where that boy was when that teanii broke away.”
"If it’s broke anywhere, I’ll fix it,” I say. The women folks go on into the house. We can hear
them, talking and fanning. The fans go whish, whish,
whish and them talking, the talking sounding kind of
hke bees murmuring in a water-bucket. The men stop on the porch, talking some, not looking at one another
"Howdy, Vernon,” they say. "Howly, Tull.” "Looks like more rain.”
400 AS I LAY DYING
‘“It does for a fact.”
‘"Yes, sir. It will rain some more.”
“It come up quick.”
“And going away slow. It don’t fail.” I go around to the back. Cash is filling up the holes
he bored in the top of it. He is trimming out plugs for them, one at a time, the wood wet and hard to work.
He could cut up a tin can and Mde the holes and no- body wouldn’t know the difference. Wouldn’t mind,
anyway. I have seen him spend a hour trimming out
a wedge like it was glass he was working, w^hen he
could have reached around and picked up a dozen
sticks and drove them into the joint and made it do. When we finished I go back to the front. The men
have gone a little piece from the house, sitting on the
ends of the boards and on the saw-horses where we
made it last night, some sitting and some squatting.
Whitfield ain’t come yet.
They look up at me, their eyes asking.
“It’s about,” I say. “He’s ready to nail.” While they are getting up Anse comes to the door
and looks at us and we return to the porch. We scrape our shoes again, careful, waiting for one another to go
in first, milling a little at the door. Anse stands inside
the door, dignified, composed. He waves us in and leads
the way into the room. They had laid her in it reversed. Cash made it clock- shape, like this y^"***^***^*i^
with every joint and seam
bevelled and scrubbed with the plane,
tight as a drum and neat as a sewing basket, and they
had laid her in it head to foot so it wouldn’t crush her
dress. It was her wedding dress and it had a flare-out bottom,
and they had laid her head to foot in it so the dress
could spread out, and they had made her a veil out of
AS I LAY HyiKG 40J
a mosquito bar so the auger holes in her face wouldn’t
show.
When we are going out, Whitfield comes. He is wet
and muddy to the waist, coming in. "The Lord comfort
this house,” he says. "I was late because the bridge has
gone. I went down to the old ford and swum my horse
over, the Lord protecting me. His grace be upon this house.”
We go back to the trestles and plank-ends and sit or
squat.
"I knowed it would go,” Armstid says.
“It s been there a long time, that ere bridge,” Quick
says. “The Lord has kept it there, you mean,” Uncle Billy
says. “I don’t know ere a man that’s touched hammer to
it in twenty-five years.”
“How long has it been there. Uncle Billy?” Quick says.
“It was built in . . . let me see ... It was in the year
1888,” Uncle Billy says. “I mind it because the first man
m cross it was Peabody coming to my house when Jody was born.”
“If I’d crossed it every time your wife littered since,
it’d a been wore out long before this, Billy,” Peabody
says. We laugh, suddenly loud, then suddenly quiet again.
We look a little aside at one another.
“Lots of folks has crossed it that won’t cross no more
bridges,” Houston says.
“It’s a fact,” Littlejohn says. “It’s so.” “One more ain’t, no ways,” Armstid says. “It’d taken
them two-three days to got her to town in the wagon.
They’d be gone a week, getting her to Jefferson and
back.”
402 AS I LAY DYING
"What’s Anse so itching to take her to Jefferson for,
anyway?” Houston says. "He promised her,” I say. "She wanted it. She come
from there. Her mind was set on it.” "And Anse is set on it, too,” Quick says. "Ay,” Uncle Billy says. "It s like a man that’s let everything
slide all his life to get set on something that will make the most trouble for everybody he knows.”
"Well, it’ll take the Lord to get her over that river now,” Peabody says. "Anse can’t do it.” ''And I reckon He v/ill,” Quick says. "He’s took care of Anse a long time, now.”
"It’s a fact,” Littlejohn says. "Too long to quit now,” Armstid says.
"1 reckon He’s like everybody else around here,” Uncle
Billy says. "He’s done it so long now He can’t quit.”
Cash comes out. He has put on a clean shirt; his hair,
wet, is combed smooth down on his brow, smooth and
black as if he had painted it on to his head. He squats
stiffly among us, we watching him.
""You feeling this weather, ain’t you?” Armstid says. Cash says notliing.
"A broke bone always feels it,” Littlejohn says. "A fel- low with a broke bone can tell it a-coming.”
""Lucky Cash got off with just a broke leg,” Armstid
says. "He might have hurt himself bedrid. How far’d you
fall, Cash?”
""Twenty-eight foot, four and a half inches, about,”
Cash says. I move over beside him.
"A fellow can sho slip quick on wet planks,” Quick says.
"It’s too bad,” I say. ""But you couldn’t a holp it.” "It’s them durn women,” he says. ""I made it to balance
with her. I made it to her measure and weight.”
AS I LAY BYIISTG 403
If it takes met hoards for folks to fall, ifs fixing to be
lots of falling before this spell is done.
‘Tou couldn t have help it,” I say. I dont mind the folks falling. Ifs the cotton and corn 1 mind.
Neither does Peabody mind the folks falling. How
'bout it, Doc?
Ifs a fact. Washed clean outen the ground it will be. Seems like something is always happening to it. 'Course it does. That's why ifs wcnih anything. If nothing
didn't happen and everybody made a big crop, do
you reckon it would be worth the raising?
Well, I be durn if I like to see my work washed outen
the ground, work I sweat over. Ifs a fact. A fellow wouldn't mind seeing it washed
up if he could just turn on the rain himself.
Who is that man can do that? Where is the colour 0/ his eyes?
Ay. The Lord 7nade it to grow. Ifs Hisn to wash up
if He sees it fittcn so. '"You couldn’t have holp it,” I say.
"It’s them durn women,” he says. In the house the women begin to sing. We hear the
first line commence, beginning to swell as they take hold,
and we rise and move toward the door, taking off our
hats and throwing our chews away. We do not go in. We
stop at the steps, clumped, holding our hats between our
lax hands in front or behind, standing with one foot advanced
and our heads lowered, looking aside, down at our hats in our hands and at the earth or now and then
at the sky and at one another’s grave, composed face. The song ends; the voices quaver away with a rich and
dying fall. Whitfield begins. His voice is bagger than him4
4^4 AS I XAY DYIKG
It's like they are not the same. Ifs like he is one, and his
voice is one, swimming on two horses side by side across the ford and coming into the house, the mud-splashed
one and the one that never even got wet, triumphant and
sad. Somebody in the house begins to ciy. It sounds like her eyes and her voice were turned back inside her, lis- tening; we move, shifting to the other leg, meeting one
another’s eye and making like they hadn’t touched.
Whitfield stops at last. The women sing again. In the
thick air it’s like their voices come out of the air, flowing
together and on in the sad, comforting tunes. When they
cease it’s like they hadn’t gone away. It’s like they had
just disappeared into the air and when we moved we
would loose them again out of the air around us, sad and
comforting. Then they finish and we put on our hats, our movements stiff, like we hadn’t never wore hats before. On the way home Cora is still singing. '1 am bounding
toward my God and my reward,” she sings, sitting on the
wagon, the shavd around her shoulders and the umbrella
open over her, though it is not raining.
''She has hern,” I say. "Wherever she went, she has her
reward in being free of Anse Bundren.” She laid there
three days in that hox, waiting for Dari and Jewel to come clean back home and get a new wheel and go hack
to where the wagon was in the ditch. Take my team^
Anse, I said.
Wee'Ll wait for ourn, he said. Shell want it so. She was

into the wagon and started and it already too late. Youll

from Jefferson. Take my team, Anse. Well wait for ourn. She’ll want it so.

It was about a mile from the house we saw him, sitting on the edge of the slough. It hadn’t had a fish in it never
that I knowed. He looked around at us, his eyes round
and calm, his face dirty, the pole across his knees. Cora
was still singing.
“This ain’t no good day to fish,” I said. “You come on home with us and me and you’ll go down to the river first thing in the morning and catch some fish.”
“It’s one in here,” he said. “Dewey Dell seen it.” “You come on with us. The river’s the best place.”
“It’s in here,” he said. “Dewey Dell seen it.” “I’m bounding toward my God and my reward,” Cora
sung. DA R L
Tt S NOT YOUB HORSE THAT S DEAD, JEWEL/’ I SAY. HE SITS A erect on the seat, leaning a little forward, woodenbacked.
The brim of his hat has soaked free of the crown
in two places, drooping across his wooden face so that,
head lowered, he looks through it like through the visoi of a helmet, looking long across the valley to where the barn leans against the bluflE, shaping the invisible horse. “See then?” I say. High above the house, against the
quick thick sky, they hang in narrowing circles. From
here they are no more than specks, implacable, paHenf
portentous. “But it’s not your horse that’s dead.”
“Goddamn you,” he says. “Goddamn you.”

Jewel’s mother is a horse. Motionless, the tall buzzards hang in soaring circles,
the clouds giving them an illusion of retrograde.
Motionless, wooden-backed, wooden-faced, he shapes
the horse in a rigid stoop like a hawk, hook-winged.
They are waiting for us, ready for the moving of it, waiting
for him. He enters the stall and waits until it kicks at him so that he can slip past and mount on to the trough
and pause, peering out across the intervening stall-tops
toward the empty path, before he reaches into the loft. ‘'Goddamn him. Goddamn him.”

hurls it completely over. For an instant it resists, as though volitional, as though within it her pole-thin body
clings furiously, even though dead, to a sort of modesty,
as she would have tried to conceal a soiled garment that
she could not prevent her body soiling. Then it breaks
free, rising suddenly as though the emaciation of her
body had added buoyancy to the planks or as though,
seeing that the garment was about to be tom fiom her,
she rushes suddenly after it in a passionate reversal that
flouts its own desire and need. Jewel’s face goes completely
green and I can hear teeth in his breath. We carry it down the hall, our feet harsh and clumsy

door. “Steady it a minute, now,” pa says, letting to. He turns back to shut and lock the door, but Jewel will not wait.

slant, it begins to rush away from me and slip down the
air like a sled upon invisible snow, smoothly evacuating
atmosphere in which the sense of it is still shaped.
"Wait, Jewel,” I say. But he will not wait. He is almost
running now and Cash is left behind. It seems to me that
the end which I now carry alone has no weight, as though it coasts like a rushing straw upon the furious tide

Dewey Dell carries the basket on one arm, in the other

face is cahn and sullen, her eyes brooding and alert; vrithin them I can see Peabody’s back like two roimd
peas in two thimbles: perhaps in Peabody’s back two of those worms which work surreptitious and steady
through you and out the other side and you waking suddenly
from sleep or from waking, with on your face an
expression sudden, intent, and concerned. She sets the
basket into the wagon and climbs in, her leg coming long
from beneath her tightening dress: that lever which
AS I LAY DYING 41: moves the world; one of that caliper which measTires the
length and breadth of life. She sits on the seat beside Var- daman and sets the parcel on her lap.
Then he enters the bam. He has not looked bade.

passes, the horse moving with a light, high-kneed driving
gait, three hundred yards back. We go on, with a motion
so soporific, so dreamlike as to be uninferant of progress,
as though time and not space were decreasing between us and it. It turns oflF at right angles, the wheel-marks of last Sunday

reined back to a swift single-foot. He sits lightly, poised, upright, wooden-faced in the saddle, the
414 AS I LAY DYING
broken hat ralced at a swaggering angle. He passes ns
swiftly, without looking at us, the horse driving, its hooves hissing in the mud. A gout of mud, back-flung,
plops on to the box. Cash leans forward and takes a tool from his box and removes it carefully. When the road
crosses Whiteleaf, the willows leaning near enough, he
breaks off a branch and scours at the stain with the wet
leaves. ANSE

T WAS JUST BEFOBE SUNDOWN. WE WERE SITTING ON THE
porch when the wagon came up the road with the five of them in it and the other one on the horse behind. One
of them raised his hand, but they was going on past the
store without stopping.
'Who’s that?” MacCallum says: I can’t think of his name: Rafe’s twin; that one it was.
"It’s Bundren, from down beyond New Hope ” Quick
says. "There’s one of them Snopes horses Jev/el’s riding.’^ "I didn’t know there was ere a one of them horses left,’* MacCallum says. "I thought you folks down there finally
contrived to give them all away.”
"Try and get that one,” Quick says. The wagon went
on.
"I bet old man Lon never gave it to him,” I says. "No,” Quick says. “He bought it from pappy.” The
wagon went on. "They must not a heard about the
bridge,” he says.
416 AS I LAY DYING
'Whatre they doing up here, anyway?” MacCallum
says. “Taking a hohday since he got his wife buried, I reckon,” Quick says. “Heading for town, I reckon, with
Tulls bridge gone too. I wonder if they amt heard about
the bridge.”
“They 11 have to fly, then,” I says. “I don t reckon there^s ere a bridge between here and Mouth of Ishatawa.”
They had something in the wagon. But Quick had been
to the funeral thi'ee days ago and we naturally never
thought anything about it except that they were heading
away from home mighty late and that they hadn’t heard
about the bridge. “You better holler at them,” MacCallum
says. Dum it, the name is right on the tip of my tongue.
So Quick hollered and they stopped and he went to the
wagon and told them.
He come back with them. “They re going to Jefferson,”
he says. “The bridge at TulFs is gone, too.” Like we didn’t
know it, and his face looked funny, around the nostrils,
but they just sat there, Bundren and the girl and the
chap on the seat, and Cash and the second one, the one
folks talks about, on a plank across the tail-gate, and the
other one on that spotted horse. But I reckon they was
used to it by then because when I said to Cash that
ihey’d have to pass by New Hope again and what they’d
better do, he just says, “I reckon we can get there.” I ain’t much for meddhng. Let every man run his own
business to suit himself, I say. But after I talked to Rachel
about them not having a regular man to fix her and it being July and all, I went back down to the bam and
tried to talk to Bundren about it. “I give her my promise,” he says. “Her mind was set on
it.”
AS I LAY DYING 417
I notice how it takes a lazy man, a man that hates moving,
to get set on moving once he does get started off, the same as he was set on staying still, like it ain’t the moving
he hates so much as the starting and stopping. And like he would be kind of proud of whatever come up to make
the moving or tlie setting still look hard. He set there on
the wagon, hunched up, blinking, listening to us tell about how quick the bridge went and how high the
water was, and I be durn if he didn’t act like he was
proud of it, like he had made tlie river rise himself.
'"You say it’s higher than you ever see it before?’' he
says. "'God’s will he done,” he says. "1 reckon it wont go
down much by morning, neither,” he says. "You better stay here tonight,” I says, "and get a early
start for New Hope tomorrow morning.” I was just sorry
for them bone-gaunted mules. I told Rachel, I says, "Well,
would you have had me turn them away at dark, eight
miles from home? What else could I do,” I says. "It won’t
be but one night, and they’ll keep it in the barn, and
they’ll sholy get started by daylight.” And so I says, "You
stay here tonight and early tomorrow you can go back to New Hope. I got tools enough, and the boys can go on
right after supper and have it dug and ready if they
want,” and then I found that girl watching me. If her
eyes had a been pistols, I wouldn’t be talking now. I be
dog if they didn’t blaze at me. And so when I went down
to the barn I come on them, her talking so she never noticed
when I come up.
"You promised her,” she says. "She wouldn’t go until you promised. She thought she could depend on you. If you don’t do it, it will be a curse on you.”
"Can’t no man say I don’t aim to keep my word,” Bum
dren says. "My heart is open to ere a man.”
"I don’t care what your heart is,” she says. She wa$
418 AS I I.AY DYING
whispering, kind of, talking fast. "Tfou promised her. YouVe got to. You Then she seen me and quit,
standing there. If they’d been pistols, I wouldn’t be talk- ing now. So when I talked to him about it, he says, "T give her my promise. Her mind is set on it.” ‘‘But seems to me she’d rather have her ma buried close
by, so she could
“It’s Addie I give the promise to,” he says. “Her mind
is set on it.” So I told them to drive it into the barn because it was
threatening rain again, and that supper was about ready.
Only they didn’t want to come in. “I thank you,” Bundren says. “We wouldn’t discommode
you. We got a little sometliing in the basket. We
can make out.” “Well,” I says, “since you are so particular about your
womenfolks, I am too. And when folks stops with us at meal-time and wont come to the table, my wife takes it as a insult.” So the girl went on to the kitchen to help Rachel. And
then Jewel come to me.
“Sho,” I says. “Help yourself outen the loft. Feed him
when you bait the mules.”
“I rather pay you for him,” he says. ‘What for?” I says. “I wouldn’t begrudge no man a
bait for his horse.”
“I rather pay you,” he says; I thought he said extra. “Extra for what?” I says. “Won’t he eat hay and corn?”
“Extra feed,” he says. “I feed him a little extra and I don’t want him beholden to no man.”
“You can’t buy no feed from me, boy,” I says. “And if he can eat that loft clean, I’ll help you load the bam on
to the wagon in the morning.”
AS I LAY BYII^-G 41^
"He amt never been beholden to no man/" he says. ‘1 rather pay you for it/" And if I had my rathers, you wouldn’t be here a-tall, I wanted to say. But I just says, "Then it"s high time he
commenced. You can’t buy no feed from me."" When Rachel put supper on, her and the girl went
and fixed some beds. But wouldn’t any of them come in. "She’s been dead long enough to get over that sort of
foolishness,” I says. Because I got just as much respect
for the dead as ere a man, but you’ve got to respect the
dead tliemselves, and a woman that’s been dead in a box
four days, tlie best way to respect her is to get her into the gi’ound as quick as you can. But they wouldn’t do it "It wouldn’t be right,” Bundren says. "Course, if the
boys wants to go to bed, I reckon I can set up with her.
I don’t begrudge her it”
So when I went back down there they were squatting on the ground around the wagon, all of them. "Let that
chap come to the house and get some sleep, anyway,” I says. "And you better come too,” I says to the girl. I wasn’t aiming to interfere with them. And I sholy hadn’t
done nothing to her that I knowed.
"He’s done already asleep,” Bundren says. They had
done put him to bed in the trough in a empty stall. ‘Well, you come on, then,” I says to her. But still she never said nothing. They just squatted there. You
couldn’t hardly see them. "How about you boys?” I says. "You got a full day tomorrow.” After a while Cash
says,
"I thank you. We can make out.” ‘We wouldn’t he beholden,” Bundren says. "I thank
you kindly.”
So I left them squatting there. I reckon after four days
they was used to it. But Rachel wasn’t.
4^0 AS I LAY DYING
‘‘Ifs an outrage/’ she says. “An outrage/’
“What could he ’a’ done?” I says. “He give her his promised
word.”
“Who’s talking about him?’”' she says. “Who cares about
him?” she says, crying. “I just vv^ish that you and him and
all the men in the world that torture us alive and flout us
dead, dragging us up and down the country
“Now, now,” I says. “You’re upset.”
“Don’t you touch me!” she says. “Don’t you touch me!”
A man can’t tell nothing about them. I lived with the same one fifteen years and I be dum if I can. And I imagined a lot of things coming up between us, but I be
durn if I ever thought it would be a body four days dead
and that a woman. But they make life hard on them not
taking it as it comes up, like a man does. So I laid there, hearing it commence to rain, thinking
about them down there, squatting around the wagon
and the rain on the roof, and thinking about Rachel cry- ing there until after a while it was like I could still hear
her crying even after she was asleep, and smelling it even when I knowed I couldn’t. I couldn’t decide even then
whether I could or not, or if it wasn’t just knowing it was
what it was. So next morning I never went down there. I heard
them hitchr^g up and then when I knowed they must be
about ready to take out, I went out the front and went
down the road toward the bridge until I heard the wagon
come out of the lot and go back toward New Hope. And
then when I come back to the house, Rachel jumped on me because I wasn’t there to make them come in to breakfast. You can’t tell about them. Just about when you
decide they mean one thing, I be durn if you not only
haven’t got to change your mind, like as not you got to take a raw-hiding for thinking they meant it.
AS I LAY dying 421
But it was still like I could smell it. And so I decided
then that it wasn't smelling it, but it was just knowing it was there, like you will get fooled now and then. But
when I went to tlie barn I knew diiBEerent. When I walked
into the hallway I saw something. It kind of hunkered
up when I come in and I thought at first it was one of
them got left, tlien I saw what it was. It was a buzzard.
It looked around and saw me and went on down the hall,
spraddle-legged, with its wings kind of hunkered out,
watching me first over one shoulder and then over the
other, like a old bald-headed man. When it got outdoors
it begun to fly. It had to fly a long time before it ever got
up into the air, with it thick and heavy and full of rain
like it was.
If they was bent on going to Jefferson, I reckon they
could have gone around up by Mount Vernon, like MacCallum
did. Hell get home about day after tomorrow,
horse-back. Then they’d be just eighteen miles from
town. But maybe this bridge being gone too has learned
him the Lord’s sense and judgment.
That MacCallum. He’s been trading with me off and
on for twelve years. I have known him from a boy up;
know his name as well as I do my own. But be dum if I can say it.
DEWEY DELL
T
he signboard comes in sight, rr is looking out at
the road now, because it can wait. New Hope. 3 mi.
it will say. New Hope. 3 mi. New Hope. 3 mi. And then
the road will begin, curving away into the trees, empty
with waiting, saying New Hope three miles.
I heard that my mother is dead. I wish I had time to
let her die. I wish I had time to wish I had. It is because
in the wild and outraged earth too soon too soon too
soon. It’s not that I wouldn’t and will not it’s that it is too soon too soon too soon. Now it begins to say it. New Hope three miles. New
Hope three miles. Thafs what they mean by the womb
of time: the agony and the despair of spreading bones,
the hard girdle in which lie the outraged entrails of
events. Cash’s head turns slowly as we approach, his pale,
empty, sad, composed and questioning face following
the red and empty curve; beside the back wheel Jewel
sits the horse, gazing straight ahead.
The land runs out of Dari’s eyes; they swim to pinpoints.
They begin at my feet and rise along my body to my face, and then my dress is gone: I sit naked on the
seat above the unhurrying mules, above the travail. Suppose
I tell him to turn. He will do what I say. Dont you
know he will do what I say? Once I waked with a black
void rushing under me. I could not see. I saw Vardaman
rise and go to the window and strike the knife into the
fish, the blood gushing, hissing like steam but I could not
422
AS I LAY DYING 425
see. Hell do as I say. He always does. I can persuade
him to anything. You know I can. Suppose I say Turn
here. That was when I died that time. Suppose I do.
Well go to 'New Hope. We wont have to go to town.
I rose and took the knife from the streaming fish still hissing and I killed Dari.
When I used to sleep with Vardaman 1 had a night- mare once 1 thought I was awake hut 1 couldnt see and
couldnt feel the bed under me and I couldnt think
what I was I couldnt think of my name I couldnt even
think I am a girl I couldnt even think I nor even think I want to wake up nor remember what was opposite to awake so I could do that I knew that something was pass- ing but 1 couldnt even think of time then all of a sudden
I knew that something was it was wind blowing over me
it was like the wind came and blew me hack from where
it was I was not blowing the room and Vardaman asleep
and all of them back under me again and going on like a
piece of cool silk dragging across my naked legs. It blows cool out of the pines, a sad steady sound. New
Hope. Was 3 mi. Was 3 mi. I believe in God I believe in God.
‘Why didn’t we go to New Hope, pa?” Vardaman says. “Mr. Samson said we was, but we done passed the road.’* Dari says, “Look, Jewel.” But he is not looking at me. He is looking at the sky. The buzzard is as still as if he were nailed to it. We turn into Tull’s lane. We pass the barn and go on, the wheels whispering in the mud, passing the green rows of cotton in the wild earth, and Vernon little across the field behind the plough. He lifts his hand as we pas?
and stands there looking after us for a long while.
“Look, Jewel,” Dari says. Jewel sits on his horse like
4M AS I LAY DYING
they were both made out of wood, looking straight
ahead.
I believe in God, God. God, I beheve in God.
TULL
A
fter they passed i taken the mule out and looped
.up the trace chains and followed. They were setting
in the wagon at tlie end of the levee. Anse was setting
there, looking at die bridge where it was swagged down
into the river with just the two ends in sight. He was
looking at it like he had believed all the time that folks had been lying to him about it being gone, but like he
was hoping all the time it really was. Kind of pleased as- tonishment he looked, setting on the wagon in his Sunday
pants, mumbling his mouth. Looking like a uncurried
horse dressed up: I don t know.
The boy was watching the bridge where it was midsunk
and logs and such drifted up over it and it swagging
and shivering hke the whole thing would go any
minute, big-eyed he was watching it, hke he was to a cir- cus. And the gal, too. When I come up she looked around
at me, her eyes kind of blaring up and going hard like I had made to touch her. Then she looked at Anse again
and then back at the water again.
It was nigh up to the levee on both sides, the earth
hid except for the tongue of it we was on going out to the bridge and then down into the water, and except for
AS I LAY DYING 4^J
knowing how the road and the bridge used to look,
fellow couldn’t tell where was the river and where thr' land. It was just a tangle of yellow and the levee not less wider than a knife-back kind of, with us setting in the
wagon and on the horse and the mule.
Dari was looking at me, and then Cash turned and
looked at me with that look in his eyes like when he was
figuring on whether the planks would fit her that night,
like he was measuring them inside of him and not asking
you to say what you thought and not even letting on he was listening if you did say it, but listening all right
Jewel hadn’t moved. He sat there on the horse, leaning a
little forward, with that same look on his face when him
and Dari passed the house yesterday, coming back to get
her.
'If it was just up, we could drive across,” Anse says. *'We could drive right on across it.” Sometimes a log would get shoved over the jam and
float on, rolling and turning, and we could watch it go on
to where the ford used to be. It would slow up and whirl
crossways and hang out of water for a minute, and you
could tell by that that the ford used to be there. "But that don’t show nothing,” I say. "It could be a bar
of quicksand built up there.” We watch the log. Then the
gal is looking at me again.
"Mr. Whitfield crossed it,” she says. "He was a horse-back,” I say. "And three days ago. It’
s
riz five foot since.”
'If the bridge was just up,” Anse says. The log bobs up and goes on again. There is a lot of trash and foam, and you can hear the water. "But it’s down,” Anse says. Cash says, "A careful fellow could walk across yonder on the planks and logs.”
426 AS I LAY DYING
"'But you couldn’t tote nothing ” I say. ^‘Likely time
you set foot on that mess, it’ll all go, too. What you think,
Dari?”
He is looking at me. He don’t say nothing; just looks at me with them queer eyes of hisn that makes folks talk. I always say it ain’t never been what he done so much
or said or anything so much as how he looks at you. It’s like he had got into the inside of you, someway. Like
somehow you was looking at yourself and your doings
outen his eyes. Then I can feel that gal watching me like I had made to touch her. She says something to Anse.
. . Mr. Whitfield . . she says. give her my promised word in the presence of the
Lord,” Anse says. '1 reckon it ain’t no need to v/orry.”
But still he does not start the mules. We set there
above the water. Another log bobs up over the jam and
goes on; we watch it check up and swing slow for a minute
where the ford used to be. Then it goes on.
"Tt might start falling tonight,” I say. 'Ton could lay over one more day.”
Then Jewel turns sideways on the horse. He has not
moved until then, and he tons and looks at me. His
face is kind of green, then it would go red and then green
again. “Get to hell on back to your damn ploughing,” he
says. “Who the hell asked you to follow us here?”
“I never meant no harm,” I say. “Shut up, Jewel,” Cash says. Jewel looks back at the
water, his face gritted, going red and green and flien red.
‘'Well,” Cash says after a while, “what you want to do?”
Anse don’t say nothing. He sets humped up, mumbling
his mouth. “If it was just up, we could drive across it,” he
says. “Come on,” Jewel says, moving the horse. “Wait,” Cash says. He looks at the bridge. We look at
AS I LAY dyings 4-^7 him, except Anse and the gal. They are looking at the
water. “Dewey Dell and Vardaman and pa better walk
across on the bridge,’' Cash says. “Vernon can help them,” Jewel says. “And we can hitch
his mule ahead of ourn.”
‘Tou ain’t going to take my mule into that water,” I say. Jewel looks at me. His eyes look like pieces of a broken
plate. “I’ll pay for your damn mule. I’ll buy it from you
right now.”
“My mule ain’t going into that water,” I say. “Jewel’s going to use his horse,” Dari says. “Why wont
you risk your mule, Vernon?”
“Shut up, Dari,” Cash says. “You and Jewel both.”
“My mule ain’t going into that water,” I say. DARL
H
e sits the horse, glaring at vernon, his lean face
suffused up to and beyond the pale rigidity of his eyes. The summer when he was fifteen, he took a spell of sleeping. One morning when I went to feed the mules the cows were still in the tie-up and then I heard pa go back
to the house and call him. When we came on back to the
house for breakfast he passed us, carrying the milk buck
ets, stumbling along like he was drunk, and he was milking
when we put the mules in and went on to the field without him. We had been there an hour and still he
never showed up. When Dewey Dell came with our
428 AS I LAY DYING
lunch, pa sent her back to find Jewel. They found him in
the tie-up, sitting on the stool, asleep.
After that, every morning pa would go in and wake
liim. He would go to sleep at the supper-table and soon
as supper was finished he would go to bed, and when I came in to bed he would be lying there like a dead man.
Yet still pa would have to wake him in the morning. He
would get up, but he wouldn’t hardly have half sense: he would stand for pa’s jawing and complaining witliout a word and take the milk buckets and go to the barn,
and once I found him asleep at the cow, the bucket in place and half-full and his hands up to the wrists in the
milk and his head against the cow’s flank. After that Dewey Dell had to do the milking. He still got up when pa waked him, going about what we told him to do in that dazed way. It was like he was trying
hard to do them; that he was as puzzled as anyone else. "Are you sick?” ma said. "Don’t you feel all right?”
"Yes,” Jewel said. "I feel all right.”
“He’s just lazy, trying me,” pa said, and Jewel standing
there, asleep on his feet hke as not. "Ain’t yoii?” he said,
waking Jewel up again to answer.
"No,” Jewel said. "You take off and stay in the house today,” ma said. "With that whole bottom piece to be busted out?” pa
said. "If you ain’t sick, what’s the matter with you?”
"Nothing,” Jewel said. "I’m all right.” "All right?” pa said. "You’re asleep on your feet this minute.”
"No,” Jewel said, "I’m all right.” "I want him to stay at home today,” ma said.
"I’ll need him,” pa said. "It’s tight enough, with all of
US to do it.”
AS I LAY DYING 4^9
‘‘You 11 just have to do the best you can with Cash and
Dari/’ ma said. "1 want him to stay in today.”
But he wouldn’t do it. ‘Tm all right,” he said, going on< But he wasn’t all right. Anybody could see it. He was los- ing flesh, and I have seen him go to sleep chopping;
watched the hoe going slower and slower up and down,
with less and less of an arc, until it stopped and he lean- ing on it motionless in the hot shimmer of the sun. Ma wanted to get the doctor, but pa didn’t want to spend the money without it was needful, and Jewel
did seem all right except for his thinness and his way of dropping off to sleep at any moment. He ate hearty
enough, except for his way of going to sleep in his plate,
with a piece of bread half-way to his mouth and his jaws
still chewing. But he swore he was all right.
It was ma that got Dewey Dell to do his milking, paid
her somehow, and the other jobs around the house that
Jewel had been doing before supper she found some way
for Dewey Dell and Vardaman to do them. And doing
them herself when pa wasn’t there. She would fix him
special tilings to eat and hide them for him. And that
may have been when I first found it out, that Addie
Bundren should be hiding anything she did, who had
tried to teach us that deceit was such that, in a world
where it was, nothing else could be very bad or very important,
not even poverty. And at times when I went in
to go to bed she would be sitting in the dark by Jewel
where he was asleep. And I knew that she was hating her
self for that deceit and hating Jewel because she had to love him so that she had to act the deceit. One night she was taken sick and when I went to the
bam to put the team in and drive to Tull’s, I couldn’t
find the lantern. I remembered noticing it on the nail the
^30 AS I LAY DYING
night before, but it wasn’t there now at midnight. So I hitched in the dark and went on and came back with
Mrs. Tull just after daylight And there the lantern was,
hanging on the nail where I remembered it and couldn’t
find it before. And then one morning while Dewey Dell was milking just before sun-up. Jewel came into the barn
from the back, through the hole in the back wall, with
the lantern in his hand.
I told Cash, and Cash and I looked at one another.
^'Rutting,” Cash said.
^"Yes,” I said. ''But why the lantern? And every night,
too. No wonder he’s losing flesh. Are you going to say
anything to him?”
"Won’t do any good,” Cash said. "What he’s doing now won’t do any good, either.” "I know. But he’ll have to learn that himself. Give him
dme to realize that it’ll save, that there’ll be just as much
more tomorrow, and he’ll be all right. I wouldn’t tell anybody,
I reckon.”
"No,” I said. "I told Dewey Dell not to. Not ma, anyway.”
"No. Not ma,”
After that I thought it was right comical: he acting so bewildered and willing and dead for sleep and gaunt as a bean-pole, and thinking he was so smart with it. And I wondered who the girl was. I thought of all I knew that
it might be, but I couldn’t say for sure. "’Taint any girl,” Cash said. "It’s a married woman
somewhere. Ain’t any young girl got that much daring
and staying power. That’s what I don’t hke about it.” ^Why?” I said. "She’ll be safer for him than a girl
Would. More judgment.”
He looked at me, his eyes fumbling, the words fum*
AS I LAY DYING 431
bling at what he was trying to say. ^It ain t always the
safe things in this world that a fellow . . ”
‘‘You mean, the safe things are not always the best
things?’^
“Ay; best/’ he said, fumbling again. “It ain’t the best
things, the things that are good for him. ... A young
boy. A fellow kind of hates to see . . . wallowing in some
body else’s mire . . .” That’s what he was trying to say. When something is new and hard and bright, there
ought to be something a little better for it than just being
safe, since the safe things are just the things that folks have been doing so long tliey have won the edges off and there’s nothing to the doing of them that leaves a man to say, That was not done before and it cannot be
done again.
So we didn’t tell, not even when after a while he’d appear
suddenly in the field beside us and go to work, without
having had time to get home and make out he had
been in bed all night. He would tell ma that he hadn’t
been hungry at breakfast or that he had eaten a piece of bread while he was hitching up the team. But Cash and 1 knew that he hadn’t been home at all on those nights
and he had come up out of the woods when we got to
tlie field. But we didn’t tell. Summer was almost over
then; we knew that when the nights began to get cool,
she would be done if he wasn’t. But when fall came and the nights began to get longer,
the only difference was that he would always be in bed
for pa to wake him, getting him up at last in that first slate of semi-idiocy like when it first started, worse than
when he had stayed out all night. “She’s sure a stayer,” I told Cash. “I used to admire
her, but I downright respect her now.”
43 ^ AS I LAY DYING
“It ain t a woman/' he said. ‘"You know ” I said. But he was watching me. “What is
it then?”
“That’s what I aim to find out/’ he said. “You can trail him through the woods all night if you
want to/’ I said. "I’m not.”
""I ain’t trailing him/’ he said. “What do you call it, then?”
“I ain’t trailing him/’ he said. “I don’t mean it that
way.”
And so a few nights later I heard Jewel get up and
climb out the window, and then I heard Cash get up
and follow him. The next morning when I went to the
barn. Cash was already there, the mules fed, and he was
helping Dewey Dell milk. And when I saw him I knew
that he knew what it was. Now and then I would catch
him watching Jewel with a queer look, like having found
out where Jewel went and what he was doing had given
him something to really think about at last. But it was
not a worried look; it was the kind of look I would see on him when I would find him doing some of Jewel’s
work around the house, work that pa still thought Jewel
w^as doing and that ma thought Dewey Dell was doing.
So I said nothing to him, believing that when he got done
digesting it in his mind, he would tell me. But he never
did.One morning—^it was November then, five months
since it started—Jewel was not in bed and he didn’t join us in the field. That was the first time ma learned anything
about what had been going on. She sent Vardaman
down to find where Jewel was, and after a while she came down too. It was as though, so long as the deceit ran
along quiet and monotonous, all of us let om'selves be deceived,
abetting it unawares or maybe through coward-
AS I LAY DYING 433
ice, since all people are cowards and naturally prefer any
kind of treachery because it has a bland outside. But
now it was like we had all—and by a kind of telepathic
agreement of admitted fear—^flung the whole thing back
like covers on the bed and we all sitting bolt upright in our nakedness, staring at one another and saying ‘'Now
is the truth. He hasn’t come home. Something has happened
to him. We let something happen to him.”
Then we saw him. He came up along the ditch and
then turned straight across the field, riding the horse. It5 mane and tail were going, as though in motion they were
carrying out the splotchy pattern of its coat: he looked
like he was riding on a big pinwheel, barebacked, with a rope bridle, and no hat on his head. It was a descendant
of those Texas ponies Flem Snopes brought here twentyfive
years ago and auctioned off for two dollars a head
and nobody but old Lon Quick ever caught his and still owned some of the blood because he could never give it away.
He galloped up and stopped, his heels in the horse’s
ribs and it dancing and swirling like the shape of its mane
and tail and the splotches of its coat had nothing whatever
to do with the flesh-and-bone horse inside them, and
he sat there, looking at us. “Where did you get that horse?” pa said. “Bought it,” Jewel said. “From Mr. Quick.”
“Bought it?” pa said. “With what? Did you buy that
thing on my word?”
“It was my money,” Jewel said. ‘T earned it. You wont
need to worry about it.” “Jewel,” ma said; “Jewel.”
“It’s all right,” Cash said. “He earned the money. He
cleaned up that forty acres of new ground Quick laid out
last spring. He did it single-handed, working at night by
434 AS I LAY DYING
lantern. I saw him. So I don t reckon that horse cost anybody
anything except Jewel. I dont reckon we need
worry.’"
‘"Jewel/" ma said. ‘"Jewel Then she said: ""You come right to the house and go to bed.’" ""Not yet/’ Jewel said. ""I ain’t got time. I got to get me a
i;addle and bridle. Mr. Quick says he
""Jewel/" ma said, looking at him. ""I’ll give—I’ll give—
•
give ” Then she began to cry. She cried hard, not hiding
her face, standing there in her faded wrapper, look- ing at him and him on the horse, looking down at her,
his face gi’owing cold and a little sick looking until he
looked away quick and Cash came and touched her. ""You go on to the house,” Cash said. ""This here ground
is too wet for you. You go on, now.” She put her hands to her face then and after a while she went on, stumbling a
little on the ploughmarks. But pretty soon she straightened
up and went on. She didn’t look back. When she
reached the ditch she stopped and called Vardaman. He
was looking at the horse, kind of dancing up and down
by it. ""Let me ride, Jewel,"" he said. ""Let me ride. Jewel.”
Jewel looked at him, then he looked away again, holding
the horse reined back. Pa watched him, mumbling his Hp.
""So you bought a horse,” he said. "You went behind my
back and bought a horse. You never consulted me; you
know how tight it is for us to make by, yet you bought
a horse for me to feed. Taken the work from your flesh and blood and bought a horse with it.” Jewel looked at pa, his eyes paler than ever. ""He won’t never eat a mouthful of yours,” he said. ""Not a mouthful. I’ll kill him first. Don’t you never think it
Don’t you never.”
AS I LAY DYING 435
‘‘Let me ride, Jewel/’ Vardaman said. ‘l-.et me ride. Jewel.” He sounded like a cricket in the grass, a little one. “Let me ride, Jewel.”
That night I found ma sitting beside the bed where he
was sleeping, in the dark. She cried hard, maybe be- cause she had to cry so quiet; maybe because she felt the same way about tears she did about deceit, hating herself
for doing it, hating him because she had to. And then I knew that I knew. I knew that as plain on that day as I knew about Dewey Dell on that day.
TULL
S
o THEY FINALLY GOT ANSE TO SAY WHAT HE WANTED TO
do, and him and the gal and the boy got out of the
wagon. But even when we were on the bridge Anse kept on looking back, like he thought maybe, once he was
outen the wagon, the whole thing would kind of blow up
and he v/ould find himself back yonder in the field again
and her laying up there in the house, waiting to die and it to do all over again.
“You ought to let them taken your mule,” he says, and
the bridge shaking and swaying under us, going down
into the moiling water like it went clean through to the
other side of the earth, and the other end coming up
outen the water like it wasn’t the same bridge a-tall and
that tliem that would walk up outen the water on that side must come from the bottom of the earth. But it was
436 AS I LAY DYING
still whole; you could tell that by the way when this end
swagged, it didn’t look like the other end swagged at
all: just like the other trees and the bank yonder were
swinging back and forth slow hke on a big clock. And
them logs scraping and bumping at the sunk part and
tilting end-up and shooting clean outen the water and
tumbling on toward the ford and the waiting, slick, whirling,
and foamy.
'What good would that ’a’ done?” I says. “If your team
can t find the ford and haul it across, what good would
three mules or even ten mules do?”
“I ain’t asking it of you,” he says. “I can always do for
me and mine. I ain’t asking you to risk your mule. It ain’t your dead; I am not blaming you.”
“They ought to went back and laid over until tomorrow,”
I says. The water was cold. It was thick, hke slush
ice. Only it kind of hved. One part of you knowed it was just water, the same thing that had been running
under this same bridge for a long time, yet when them
logs would come spewing up outen it, you were not sur- prised, like they was a part of water, of the waiting and
the tlareat. It was like when we was across, up out of the water
again and the hard earth under us, that I was surprised.
It was hke we hadn’t expected the bridge to end on the
other bank, on something tame like the hard eai1h again
that we had tromped on before this time and knowed
well. Like it couldn’t be me here, because I’d have had
better sense than to done what I just done. And when I looked back and saw the other bank and saw my mule
standing there where I used to be and knew that I’d have to get back there some way, I knew it couldn’t
be, because I just couldn’t think of anything that could
make me cross that bridge ever even once. Yet here I was,
AS I LAY DYING 437
and tlie fellow that could make himself cross it twice^
couldn t be me, not even if Cora told him to. It was that boy. I said “Here; you better take a holt of
my hand,’’ and he waited and held to me. I be dum if it wasn’t like he come back and got me; like he was saying
They won’t nothing hurt you. Like he was saying about
a fine place he knowed where Christmas come twice with
Thanksgiving and lasts on through the winter and the
spring and the summer, and if I just stayed with hun I’d be all right too. When I looked back at my mule it was like he was one
of these here spy-glasses and I could look at him standing
there and see all the broad land and my house
sweated outen it like it was the more the sweat, the
broader the land; the more the sweat, the tighter the
house because it would take a tight house for Cora, to hold Cora Hke a jar of milk in the spring: you’ve got to have a tight jar or you’ll need a powerful spring, if you
have a big spring, why then you have the incentive to have tight, well-made jars, because it is your milk, sour or
not, because you would rather have milk that will sour than to have milk that won’t, because you are a man. And him holding to my hand, his hand that hot and
confident, so that I was like to say: Look-a-here. Can’t
you see that mule yonder? He never had no business over
here, so he never come, not being nothing but a mule.
Because a fellow can see ever now and then that children
have more sense than him. But he don’t like to admit it to them until they have beards. After they have a beard,
they are too busy because they don’t know if they’ll ever
quite make it back to where they were in sense before
they was haired, so you don’t mind admitting then to
folks that are worrying about the same thing that ain’t worth the worry that you are yourself.
^38’ AS I LAY DYING
Then we was over and we stood there, looking at Cash
turning the wagon around. We watched them drive back
down the road to where the trail turned off into the bottom.
After a while tlie wagon was out of sight.
‘We better get on down to the ford and git ready to
help,” I said. ‘T give her my word,” Anse says. “It is sacred on me. I know you begrudge it, but she will bless you in heaven.”
“Well, they got to finish circumventing the land before
they can dare the water,” I said. “Come on.”
“It’s the turning back,” he said. “It ain’t no luck in turn- ing back.”
He was standing there, humped, mournful, looldng
at the empty road beyond tire swagging and swaying
bridge. And tliat gal, too, with the lunch-basket on one arm and that package under the other. Just going to town. Bent on it. They would risk the fire and the eaiih
and the water and all just to eat a sack of bananas. “You
ought to laid over a day,” I said. “It would ’a’ fell some by morning. It mought not ’a’ rained tonight. And it can t get no higher.”
“I give my promise,” he says. “She is counting on it.” DARL
B
efore us the thick dark current runs, it talks up
to us in a murmur become ceaseless and myriad, the
yellow surface dimpled monstrously into fading swirls
travelling along the surface for an instant, silent, imper-
AS I LAY DYING 439
manent and profoundly significant, as though just beneath
the surface something huge and ahve waked for a moment of lazy alertness out of and into light slumber
again.
It clucks and murmurs among the spokes and about
the mules^ knees, yellow, scummed with flotsam and
with thick soiled gouts of foam as though it had sweat,
lathering, like a driven horse. Through the undergrowth
it goes with a plaintive sound, a musing sound; in it the
unwinded cane and saplings lean as before a httle gale,
swaying without reflections as though suspended on in- visible wires from the branches overhead. Above the
ceaseless surface they stand—trees, cane, vines—^rootless, severed from the earth, spectral above a scene of im^ mense yet circumscribed desolation filled with the voice
of the waste and mournful water. Cash and I sit in the wagon; Jewel sits the horse at the off rear-wheel. The horse is trembling, its eye rolling
wild and baby-blue in its long pink face, its breathing
stertorous like groaning. He sits erect, poised, looking
quietly and steadily and quickly this way and that, his face cahn, a little pale, alert. Cash's face is also gravely
composed; he and I look at one another with long probing
looks, looks tliat plunge unimpeded through one another's
eyes and into the ultimate secret place where for an instant Cash and Dari crouch flagrant and unabashed
in all the old terror and the old foreboding, alert and
secret and without shame. When we speak our voices are
quiet, detached.
^T reckon we re still in the road, all right.”
"Tull taken and cut them two big whiteoaks. I heard
tell how at high water in the old days they used to line up the ford by them trees.” "I reckon he did that two years ago when he was log
4-io AS I LAY DY'ING
ging down here. I reckon he never thought that anybody
would ever use this ford again.’"
"'I reckon not. Yes, it must have been then. He cut a
sight of timber outen here then. Payed oflE that mortgage
with it, I hear tell.” ‘Tfes. Yes, I reckon so. I reckon Vernon could have
done that.”
'‘That’s a fact. Most folks tliac logs in this here country,
they need a dum good farm to support the sawmill. Or
maybe a store. But I reckon Vernon could.”
'T reckon so. He’s a sight.”
"Ay. Vernon is. Yes, it must still be here. He never would have got that timber out of here if he hadn’t
cleaned out that old road. I reckon we are still on it.’"' He looks about quietly, at the position of the trees, leaning
this way and that, looking back along the fioorless road shaped vaguely high in air by the position of the
lopped and felled trees, as if the road too had been
soaked free of earth and floated upward, to leave in its spectral tracing a monument to a still more profound des- olation than this above which we now sit, talking quietly
of old security and old trivial tilings. Jewel looks at him^
then at me, then his face turns in in that quiet, constant,
questing about the scene, the horse trembling quietly and
steadily between his knees.
"He could go on ahead slow and sort of feel it out,” I say.
'Y^es,” Cash says, not looking at me. His face is in
profile as he looks forward where Jewel has moved on
ahead.
"He can t miss the river,” I say. "He couldn’t miss seeing
it fifty yards ahead.”
Cash does not look at me, his face in profile. "If I’d
AS I LAY DYING 441
just suspicioned it, I could come down last week and
taken a sight on it/" ‘'The bridge was up then,"" I say. He does not look at me. “Whitfield crossed it a-horse-back/"
Jewel looks at us again, his expression sober and alert and subdued. His voice is quiet. “What you want me to
do?"" “I ought CO come down last week and taken a sight on
it/" Cash says. “We couldnt have known/" I say. “There wasn"t any
way for us to know."’ “ni ride on ahead,"" Jewel says. “You can follow where
I am."" He lifts the horse. It shrinks, bowed; he leans to it, speaking to it, lifting it forward almost bodily, it setting
its feet doxm with gingerly splashings, trembling, breathing
harshly. He speaks to it, murmurs to it. “Go on,"" he
says. “I ain’t going to let nothing hurt you. Go on, now.""
“Jewel,"" Cash says. Jewel does not look back. He lifts the horse on. “He can swim,"" I say. ‘Tf he’ll just give the horse time,
anyhow . . When he was born, he had a bad time of it. Ma would sit in the lamplight, holding him on a pillow on her lap. We would wake and find her so. There would
be no sound from them.
“That pillow was longer than him,” Cash says. He is leaning a little forward. “I ought to come down last week and sighted. I ought to done it.” “That’s right,” I say. “Neither his feet nor his head
would reach the end of it. You couldnt have known,” I say.
“I ought to done it,” he says. He lifts the reins. The
mules move, into the traces; the wheels munnur alive iia the water. He looks back and down at Addie. “It ain’t on
a balance,” he says.
442 AS I LAY DYIKG
At last the trees open; against the open river Jewel sits the horse, half turned, it belly deep now. Across the river we can see Vernon and pa and Vardaman and Dewey
Dell. Vernon is waving at us, waving us further downstream.
'We are too high up,” Cash says. Vernon is shouting
too, but we cannot make out what he says for the noise
of the water. It runs steady and deep now, unbroken,
without sense of motion until a log comes along, turning
slowly. 'Watch it,” Cash says. We watch it and see it falter and hang for a moment, the current building up behind
it in a thick wave, submerging it for an instant before it shoots up and tumbles on. "There it is,” I say. "Ay,” Cash says. "It s there.” We look at Vernon again.
He is now flapping his arms up and down. We move on
downstream, slowly and carefully, watching Vernon. He
drops his hands. "This is the place,” Cash says. "Well, goddamn it, lets get across, then,” Jewel says. He
moves the horse on. "You wait,” Cash says. Jewel stops again.
"Well, by God- ” he says. Cash looks at the water,
then he looks back at Addie. "It ain't on a balance,” he
says. 'Then go on back to the goddamn bridge and walk
across,” Jewel says. "You and Dari both. Let me on that
wagon.”
Cash does not pay him any attention. "It ain't on a
balance,” he says. "Yes, sir. We got to watch it.” 'Watch it, hell,” Jewel says. "You get out of that wagon
and let me have it. By God, if you re afraid to drive it over . . His eyes are pale as two bleached chips in his
face. Cash is looking at him.
AS I LAY DYING 443
^We'll get it over,” he says. "1 tell you v^hat you do. You
ride on back and walk across the bridge and come down
the other bank and meet us with the rope. Vemonll take
your horse home with him and keep it till we get back.”
""You go to hell,” Jewel says. 'Tou take the rope and come down the bank and be
ready with it,” Cash says. ''Three can t do no more than
two can—one to drive and one to steady it.” "Goddamn you,” Jewel says. "Let Jewel take the end of the rope and cross upstream
of us and brace it,” I say. "Will you do that, Jewel?”
Jewel watches me, hard. He looks quick at Cash, then
back at me, his eyes alert and hard. "I don t give a damn.
Just so we do something. Setting here, not lifting a god'
damn hand . , "Let's do that, Cash,” I say.
"I reckon well have to,” Cash says. The river itself is not a hundred yards across, and pa
and Vernon and Vardaman and Dewey Dell are the
only things in sight not of that single monotony*of desolation
leaning with that terrific quality a httle from right
to left, as though we had reached the place where the
motion of the wasted world accelerates just before the
final precipice. Yet they appear dwarfed. It is as though
the space between us were time: an irrevocable quality.
It is as though time, no longer running straight before us
in a diminishing line, now runs parallel between us like a looping string, the distance being the doubling accretion
of the thread and not the interval between. The
mules stand, their forequarters aheady sloped a little, their rumps high. They too are breathing now with a deep groaning sound; looking back once, their gaze
sweeps across us with in their eyes a wild, sad, profound
444 AS I I.AY DYING
and despairing quality as though they had already seen
in the thick water the shape of the disaster which they
could not speak and we could not see. Cash turns back into the wagon. He lays his hands flat on Addie, rocking her a little. His face is calm, downsloped,
calculant, concerned. He lifts his box of tools and wedges it forward under tire seat; together we shove
Addie forward, wedging her between the tools and the
wagon-bed. Then he looks at me.
'‘No,” I say. "I reckon 111 stay. Might take both of us.” From the tool-box he takes his coiled rope and carries the end twice around the seat stanchion and passes the
end to me without tying it. The other end he pays out to Jewel, who takes a turn about his saddle-horn.
He must force the horse down into the current. It moves, high-kneed, arch-necked, boring and chafing.
Jewel sits lightly forward, his knees lifted a httle; again his swift alert calm gaze sweeps upon us and on. He lowers
the horse into the stream, speaking to it in a soothing murmur. The horse slips, goes under to the saddle, surges
to its feet again, the current building up against Jewel’s
thighs.
"Watch yourself,” Cash says. "Tm on it now,” Jewel says. "You can come ahead
now.”
Cash takes the reins and lowers the team carefully and
skilfully into the stream, I felt the current take us and I knew we were on the
ford by that reason^ since it was only by means of that
slipping contact that we could tell tliat we were in motion
at all. What had once been a flat surface was now a
succession of troughs and hillocks lifting and falling
about us, shoving at us, teasing at us with light lazy
AS I LAY DYING 445
touches in the vain instants of solidity underfoot. Cash
looked back at me, and then 1 knew that we were gone.
But 1 did not realize the reason for the rope until I saw
the log. It surged up out of the water and stood for an
instant upright upon that surging and heaving desolation
like Christ. Get out and let the current take you down to the bend, Cash said. You can make it all right. No, I
said, Td get just as wet that way as this. The log appears suddenly between two hills, as if it had rocketed suddenly from the bottom of the river. Upon tlie end of it a long gout of foam hangs like the
beard of an old man or a goat. When Cash speaks to me
I know that he has been watching it all the time, watching
it and watching Jewel ten feet ahead of us. “Let the
rope go,” he says. With his other hand he reaches down
and reeves the two turns from the stanchion. “Ride on. Jewel,” he says; “see if you can pull us ahead of the log.*' Jewel shouts at the horse; again he appears to Hft it bodily between his knees. He is just above the top of the ford and the horse has a purchase of some sort for it surges forward, shining wetly half out of water, crashing on in a succession of lunges. It moves unbelievably fast; by that token Jewel realizes at last that the rope is free, for I can see him sawing back on the reins, his head
turned, as the log rears in a long sluggish lunge between
us, bearing down upon the team. They see it too; for a moment they also shine black out of water. Then the
downstream one vanishes, dragging the other with him;
the wagon sheers crosswise, poised on the crest of the
ford as the log strikes it, tilting it up and on. Cash is halt turned, the reins running taut from his hand and disappearing
into the water, the other hand reached back
upon Addie, holding her jammed over against the high
44^ AS I LAY DATING
side of tHe wagon. he says quiet])’. ^'Sta}/ away from the team and don’t try to fight it. It’ll swing
you into the bend all right.” 'TTou come too,” I say. Vernon and Vardaman are run- ning along the bank, pa and Dewey Dell stand \^^atching
us, Dewey Dell with the basket and the package in her
arms. Jewel is trying to fight the horse back. The head of one mule appears, its eyes wide; it looks back at us for an
instant, making a sound almost human. The head vanishes
again.
“Back, Jewel,” Cash shouts. “Back, Jewel.” For another
instant I see him leaning to the tilting wagon, his arm
braced back against Addie and his tools; I see the
bearded head of the rearing log strike up again, and beyond
it Jewel holding the horse upreared, its head
wrenched around, hammering its head with his fist. I jump from the wagon on the downstream side. Between
two hills I see the mules once more. They roJ i up out of the water in succession, turning completely over, theii legs stiffly extended as when they had lost contact witb
the earth. VARDAMAN

Dari hadn’t caught her yet
He came up to see anc I hollering catch her Dari catch
her and he didn’t come back because she was too heavy
he had to go on catching at her and I hollering catch her
darl catch her darl because in the water she could go
faster than a man and Darl had to grabble for her so 1 knew he could catch her because he is the best grabbler even with the mules in the way again they dived up roll- ing their feet stiff rolling down again and their backs up
now and Darl had to again because in the water she
could go faster than a man or a woman and I passed Ver- non and he wouldn’t get in the water and help Darl he
would grabble for her with Darl he knew but he
wouldn’t help
The mules dived up again diving their legs stiff their
stiff legs rolling slow and then Dari again and I hollering
catch her darl catch her head her into the bank dar\
and Vemon wouldn’t help and then Darl dodged past the
mules where he could he had her under the water coming
in to the bank coming in slow because in the water she
fought to stay under die water but Darl is strong and he was coming in slow and so I knew he had her because he came slow and I ran down into the water to help and I couldn’t stop hollering because Darl was strong and
steady holding her xmder the water even if she did fight
he would not let her go he was seeing me and he would
hold her and it was all right now it was all right now it was all right
Then he comes up out of the water. He comes a long
way up slow before his hands do but he^s got to have
her got to so I can bear it. Then his hands come up and
all of him above the water, I cant stop. I have not got

is ma, Dari?” I said. ‘"You never got her. You
loiew she is a fish but you let her get away. You never
got her. Dari. Dari. Dari.” I began to run along the bank,
watching the mules dive up slow again and then down
again.
TULL
WHEN I TOLD CORA. HOW DARL JUMPED OUT OF THE
wagon and left Cash sitting there trying to save it and the wagon turning over, and Jewel that was almost
to the bank fighting that horse back where it had more
sense than to go, she says “And you re one of the folks that says Dari is the queer one, the one that ain t bright,
and him the only one of them that had sense enough to
get oflF that wagon. I notice Anse was too smart to been
on it a-tall.” “He couldn t V done no good, if he’d been there,’’ I
said. “They was going about it right and they would
have made it if it hadn’t a-been for that log.”
“Log, fiddlesticks,” Cora said. “It was the hand of
God.”
“Then how can you say it was foolish?” I said. “Nobody
can't guard against the hand of God. It would be sacri- lege to try to.”
AS I LAY DYING 449
‘'Then why dare it?’’ Cora says. “Tell me that.” “Anse didn’t/’ I said. “That’s just what you faulted him
for.” “His place was there/’ Cora said. “If he had been a man, he would ’a’ been there instead of making his sons do what he dursn’t.”
“I don’t know what you want, then,” I said. “One
breath you say they was daring the hand of God to try
it, and the next breath you jump on Anse because he
wasn’t with them.” Then she begun to sing again, working
at the wash-tub, with that singing look in her face
like she had done give up folks and all their foolishness
and had done went on ahead of them, marching up the
sky, singing.
The wagon hung for a long time while the current
built up under it, shoving it oflE the ford, and Cash lean- ing more and more, trying to keep the coflBn braced so it wouldn’t slip down and finish tilting the wagon over. Soon as the wagon got tilted good, to where the current could finish it, the log went on. It headed around the
wagon and went on good as a swimming man could have
done. It was like it had been sent there to do a job and
done it and went on. When the mules finally kicked loose, it looked for a minute like maybe Cash would get the wagon back. It looked like him and the wagon wasn’t moving at all, and
just Jewel fighting that horse back to the wagon. Then
that boy passed me, running and hollering at Dari and
the gal trying to catch him, and then I see the mules come
rolling slow up out of the water, their legs spraddled
stiff Hke they had balked upside down, and roll on into the water again.
Then the wagon tilted over and then it and Jewel and
the horse was all mixed up together. Cash went outen
450 AS I LAY DYING
sight, still holding the cofiBn braced, and then I couldn t
tell anything for the horse lunging and splashing. I thought that Cash had give up then and was swimming
for it and I was yelling at Jewel to come on back and then
all of a sudden him and the horse went under too and I thought they was all going. I knew that the horse had got
dragged off the ford too, and with that wild drowning
horse and that wagon and tliat loose box, it was going to be pretty bad, and there I was, standing knee deep in the water, yelh'ng at Anse beliind me: “See what you
done now. See what you done now?”
The horse come up again. It was headed for the bank
now, throwing its head up, and then I saw one of them
holding to the saddle on the downstream side, so I started running along the bank, trying to catch sight of Cash because
he couldn’t swim, yelling at Jewel where Cash was
like a durn fool, bad as that boy that was on down the
bank still hollering at Dari.
So I went down mto the water so I could still keep some kind of a grip in the mud, when I saw Jewel, He
was middle deep, so I knew he was on the ford, anyway,
leaning hard upstream, and then I see the rope and then
I see the water building up where he was holding the
wagon snubbed just below the ford. So it was Cash holding to the horse when it come
splashing and scrambling up the bank, moaning and
groaning like a natural man. When I come to it it was
just kicking Cash loose from his holt on the saddle. His
face turned up a second when he was sliding back into
the water. It was grey, with his eyes closed and a long
swipe of mud across his face. Then he let go and turned
over in the water. He looked just like an old bundle of
clothes kind of washing up and down against the bank.
He looked like he was laying tliere in the water on his
AS I LAY DYI^^-Q 451
face, rocking up and down a little, looking at something on the bottom.
We could watch tlie rope cutting down into the water,
and we could feel tire weight of the wagon kind of blump
and lunge lazy like, like it just as soon as not, and that rope cutting down into the water hard as a iron bar. We
could hear the water hissing on it like it was red hot. Like it was a straight ii*on bar stuck into the bottom and
us holding the end of it, and the wagon lazing up and
down, kind of pusliing and prodding at us like it had come around and got behind us, lazy like, like it just as soon as not when it made up its mind. There was a shoat come by, biowed up like a balloon: one of them
spotted shoals of Lon Quicks. It bumped against the
rope like it was a iron bar and bumped off and went on, and us watching that rope slanting down into the water. We watched it.

ASH LIES ON HIS BACK ON THE EAETH, HIS HEAl RAISED on a rolled garment. His eyes are closed, his face is grey, his hair plastered in a smooth smear across his fore- head as though done with a paint-brush. His face appears
sunken a little, sagging from the bony ridges of eyesockets,
nose, gums, as though the wetting had slacked
the firmness which had held the skin full; his teeth, set in pale gums, are parted a little as if he had been laughing
452 AS I LAY DYING
quietly. He lies pole-thin in his wet clothes, a little pool
of vomit at his head and a thread of it running from the
corner of his mouth and down his cheek where he
couldn’t turn his head quick or far enough, until Dewey
Dell stoops and wipes it away with the hem of her dress. Jewel approaches. He has the plane. 'Vernon just
found the square,” he says. He looks down at Cash, dripping
too. "Ain’t he talked none yet?”
"He had his saw and hammer and chalk-line and rule,”
I say. "I know that.” Jewel lays the square down. Pa watches him. 'They
can’t be far away,” pa says. "It all went together. Was
there ere a such misfortunate man.”
Jewel does not look at pa. "You better call Vardanian
back here,” he says. He looks at Cash. Then he turns and
goes away. "Get him to talk soon as he can,” he says, "so he can tell us what else there was.”
We return to the river. The wagon is hauled clear, the
wheels chocked (carefully: we all helped; it is as though
upon the shabby, familiar, inert shape of the wagon there
lingered somehow, latent yet still immediate, that vio- lence which had slain the mules that drew it not an hour
since) above the edge of the flood. In the wagon bed it lies profoundly, the long pale planks hushed a little with
wetting yet stiU yellow, like gold seen through water, save for two long muddy smears. We pass it and go on to the bank.
One end of the rope is made fast to a tree. At the
edge of the stream, knee-deep, Vardaman stands, bent
forward a little, watching Vernon with rapt absorption.
He has stopped yelling and he is wet to the armpits.
Vernon is at the other end of the rope, shoulder-deep in the river, looking back at Vardaman. "Further back than
AS I LAY DYING 453
that/' he says. "'You git back by the tree and hold the
rope for me, so it can't shp."
Vardaman backs along the rope, to the tree, moving
blindly, watching Vernon. When we come up he looks at us once, his eyes round and a little dazed. Then he looks
at Vernon again in that posture of rapt alertness. "T got the hammer too," Vernon says. "Looks hke we
ought to done already got that chalk-line. It ought to
floated." "Floated clean away,” Jewel says. "We wont get it. We ought to find the saw, though.”
"I reckon so," Vernon says. He looks at the water. "That
chalk-line, too. What else did he have?”
"He ain’t talked yet,” Jewel says, entering the water. He
looks back at me. "You go back and get him roused up to
talk,” he says. "Pa’s there,” I say. I follow Jewel into the water, along
the rope. It feels alive in my hand, bellied faintly in a prolonged and resonant arc. Vernon is watching me. "You better go,” he says. "You better be there." "Let’s see what else we can get before it washes on down,” I say. We hold to the rope, the current curling and dimpHng
about our shoulders. But beneath that false blandness the
true force of it leans against us lazily. I had not thought
that water in July could be so cold. It is hke hands
moulding and prodding at the very bones. Vernon is
still looking back toward the bank.
"Reckon it’ll hold us all?" he says. We too look back,
following the rigid bar of tire rope as it rises from the
water to the tree and Vardaman crouched a little beside
it, watching us. "Wish my mule wouldn’t strike out for home,” Vernon says.
454 AS I LAY DYING
'"Come on ” Jewel says. "Let’s get outen here.'' We submerge in turn, holding to the rope, being
clutched by one another while the cold wall of the
water sucks the slanting mud backward and upstream
from beneath our feet and we are suspended so, groping
along the cold bottom. Even the mud there is not still. It has a chill, scouring quality, as tliough the earth under
us were in motion too. We touch and fumble at one
another’s extended arms, letting ourselves go cautiously
against the rope; or, erect in turn, watch the water suck
and boil where one of the other two gropes beneath the
surface. Pa has come down to the shore, watching us. Vernon comes up, streaming, his face sloped down into
his pmsed blowing mouth. His mouth is bluish, like a cir- cle of weathered rubber. He has the rule. "He’ll be glad of that,” I say. "It’s right new. He bought
it just last month out of tlie catalogue.”
"If we just knowed for sho wiaat else,” Vernon says, looking over his shoulder and then turning to face
where Jewel had disappeared. “Didn’t he go down ’fore me?” Vernon says.
“I don’t know,” I say. “I think so. Yes. Yes, he did.” We watch the thick curling surface, sti'eaming away
from us in slow whorls.
“Give him a pull on the rope,” Vernon says. “He’s on your end of it,” I say. “Ain’t nobody on my end of it,” he says. “Pull it in,” I say. But he has aheady done that, holding
the end above the water; and then we see Jewel. He
is ten yards away; he comes up, blowing, and looks at us, tossing his long hair back with a jerk of his head, then
he looks toward the bank; we can see him filling his lungs.
“Jewel,” Vernon says, not loud, but his voice going full
AS I LAY DYING 455
and clear along the water, peremptory yet tactful. "It’ll be back here. Better come back.”
Jewel dives again. We stand there, leaning back against
the current, watching the water where he disappeared^,
holding tlie dead rope between us like two men holding
the nozzle of a fire-hose, waiting for the water. Suddenly
Dewey Dell is behind us in the water. "You make him come back,” she says. "Jewel!” she says. He comes up
again, tossing his hair back from his eyes. He is swimming
now, toward the bank, the current sweeping him
downstream quartering. "You, Jewell” Dewey Dell says. We stand holding the rope and see him gain Ae
bank and climb out. As he rises from the water, he stoops
and picks up something. He comes back along the bank.
He has found the chalk-line. He comes opposite us and
stands there, looking about as if he were seeking some^
thing. Pa goes on down the bank. He is going back to look at the mules again where their round bodies float and rub quietly together in the slack water within the
bend.
"What did you do with the hammer, Vernon?” Jewel
says.
"I give it to him,” Vernon says, jerking his head at Vardaman. Vardaman is looking after pa. Then he looks
at Jewel. ‘With the square.” Vernon is watching Jewel.
He moves toward the bank, passing Dewey Dell and me. "You get on out of here,” I say. She says nothing, look- ing at Jewel and Vernon.
"Where’s the hammer?” Jewel says. Vardaman scuttle.^ up the bank and fetches it. "It’s heavier than the saw,” Vernon says. Jewel is tying
the end of the chalk-line about the hammer shaft. "Hammer’s got the most wood in it,” Jewel says. He
and Vernon face one another, watching Jewel’s hands.
45^ AS I LAY DYING
"And flatter, too,” Vernon says. "It'd float three to one,
almost. Try the plane.”
Jewel looks at Vernon. Vernon is tall, too; long and
lean, eye to eye they stand in their close wet clothes. Lon
Quick could look even at a cloudy sky and tell the time
to ten minutes. Big Lon I mean, not little Lon.
"Why don't you get out of the water?” I say.
"It won't float like a saw,” Jewel says.
"It'll float nigher to a saw than a hammer will,” Vernon
says. "Bet you,” Jewel says.
"I won't bet,” Vernon says. They stand tliere, watching Jewel's still hands.
""Hell,” Jewel says. ""Get the plane, then.” So they get the plane and tie it to the chalk-line and
enter the water again. Pa comes back along the bank. He
stops for a while and looks at us, hunched, mournful, like a failing steer or an old tall bird. Vernon and Jewel return, leaning against the current.
""Get out of the way,” Jewel says to Dewey Dell. ""Get out
of the water.”
She crowds against me a little so they can pass, Jewel
holding the plane high as though it were perishable, the
blue sti'ing trailing back over his shoulder. They pass
us and stop; they fall to arguing quietly about just where
the wagon went over.
""Dari ought to know,” Vernon says. They look at me.
"I don't know,” I says. ""I wasn't there that long,”
""Hell,” Jewel says. They move on, gingerly, leaning
against the current, reading the ford with their feet. ""Have you got a holt of the rope?” Vernon says. Jewel
does not answer. He glances back at the shore, calculant,
then at the water. He flmgs the plane outward, letting
ihe string run through his fingers, his fingers turning blue
AS I LAY DYING 457
where it runs over them. When the line stops, he hands
it back to Vernon.
“Better let me go this time ” Vernon says. Again Jewel
does not answer; we watch him duck beneali the surface.
“Jewel,” Dewey Dell whimpers.
“It ain t so deep there ” Vernon says. He does not look
back. He is watching the water where Jewel went under.
When Jewel comes up he has the saw. When we pass the wagon pa is standing beside it, scrubbing at the two mud smears with a handful of
leaves. Against the jungle Jewel’s horse looks like a patchwork
quilt hung on a line. Cash has not moved. We stand above him, holding
the plane, the saw, the hammer, the square, the rule, the
chalk-line, while Dewey Dell squats and Ufts Cash s head
“Cash,” she says; “Cash.”
He opens his eyes, staring profoundly up at our in^ verted faces.
“If ever was such a misfortunate man,” pa says. “Look, Cash,” we say, holding the tools up so he can
see; “what else did you have?”
He tries to speak, rolhng his head, shutting his eyes. “Cash,” we say; “Cash.”
It is to vomit he is turning his head. Dewey Dell wipes
his mouth on the wet hem of her dress; then he can
speak.
“It’s his saw-set,” Jewel says. “The new one he bought
when he bought the rule.” He moves, turning away. Ver- non looks up after him, still squatting. Then he rises and
follows Jewel down to the water.
“If ever was such a misfortunate man,” pa says. He
looms tall above us as we squat; he looks like a figure
carved clumsily from tough wood by a drunken carica-
458 AS I LAY DYING
turist. ‘Its a trial/' he says. “But I don't begrudge her it. No man can say I begrudge her it.” Dewey Dell has laid Cash's head back on the folded coat, tsvisting his head a
little to avoid the vomit. Beside hnn his tools lie. “A fel- low might call it lucky it was tlie same leg he broke
when he fell offen that church/' pa says. “But I don't begrudge
her it.” Jewel and Vernon are in the river again. From here
they do not appear to violate the surface at all; it is as though it had severed them both at a single blow, the
two torsos moving with infinitesimal and ludicrous care Upon the surface. It looks peaceful, like machinery does
after you have watched it and listened to it for a long
time. As tliough the clotting which is you had dissolved
into the myriad original motion, and seeing and hearing
in themselves blind and deaf; fury in itself quiet with
stagnation. Squatting, Dewey Dell's wet dress shapes for the dead eyes of three blind men those mammalian ludicrosities
which are the horizons and the valleys of the
earth. CASH

CORA
O
NE DAY WERE TALKING. SHE HAD NEVER BEEN PURE
religious, not even after that summer at the camp
meeting when Brother Whitfield wrestled with her spirit,
singled her out and strove witli the vanity in her moiial
heart, and I said to her many a time, ''God gave you
children to comfort your hard human lot and for a token
of His own sufiEering and love, for in lo^^^ you conceived
and bore them.” I said that because she took God’s love
and her duty to Him too much as a matter of course, and such conduct is not pleasing to Him. I said, "He gave
us the gift to raise our voices in His undying praise” be- cause I said there is more rejoicing in heaven over one
sinner tlian over a hundred that never sinned. And she
said "My daily life is an acknowledgment and expiation
of my sin” and I said "Who are you, to say what is sin and what is not sin? It is the Lord’s part to judge; ours to praise His mercy and His holy name in the hearing ol our fellow mortals” because He alone can see into the
heart, and just because a woman s life is right in the sight of man, she can t know if there is no sin in her heart without
she opens her heart to the Lord and receives His
grace. I said, "Just because you have been a faithful wife
is no sign that there is no sin in your heart, and just be- cause your life is hard is no sign that the Lord’s grace
is absolving you.” And she said, "I know my own sin. I know that I deserve my punishment. I do not begrudge
it.” And I said, "It is out of your vanity that you would
judge sin and salvation in the Lord’s place. It is our mor-
459
460 AS I LAY LYING
tal lot to suflrer and to raise our voices in praise of Hiin
who judges the sin and offers the salvation through our
trials and tribulations time out of mind amen. Not even
after Brother Whitfield, a godly man if ever one breathed
God’s breath, prayed for you and strove as never a man
could except him,” I said. Because it is not us that can judge our sins or know
what is sin in the Lords eyes. She has had a hard Hfe,
but so does every woman. But you’d think from the way
she talked that she knew more about sin and salvation
than the Lord God Himself, tlran them who have strove and laboured with the sin in this human world. When
the only sin she ever committed was being partial to Jewel tliat never loved her and was its own punishment,
in preference to Dari that was touched by God Himself
and considered queer by us mortals and that did love
her. I said, ''There is your sin. And your punishment too. Jewel is your punishment. But where is your salvation?
And life is short enough,” I said, "to win eternal grace in. And God is a jealous God. It is His to judge and to mete; not yours.”
'T know,” she said. "I Then she stopped, and I
said,
"Know what?”
"Nothing,” she said. "He is my cross and he will be my
salvation. He will save me from the water and from the
fire. Even though I have laid down my life, he will save me."How do you know, without you open your heart to Him and lift your voice in His praise?” I said. Then I real- ized that she did not mean God. I realized that out of the
vanity of her heart she had spoken sacrilege. And I went
down on my knees right there. I begged her to kneel and
open her heart and cast from it the devil of vanity and
AS I LAY DYINtr 461
cast herself upon the mercy of the Lord. But she wouldn’t.
She just sat there, lost in her vanity and her pride, that had closed her heart to God and set that selfish mortal
boy in His place. Kneeling there I prayed for her. I prayed for that poor bhnd woman as I had never prayed
for me and mine.
ADDIE
I
N THE AFTERNOON WHEN SCHOOL WAS OUT AND THE
last one had left with his little dirty snuffling nose, in- stead of going home I would go down the hill to‘ the
spring where I could be quiet and hate them. It would
be quiet there then, with the water bubbling up and away
and tlie sun slanting quiet in the trees and the quiet
smelling of damp and rotting leaves and new earth; es' pecially in the early spring, for it was worst then.
I could just remember how my father used to say
that the reason for living was to get ready to stay dead
a long time. And when I would have to look at them day
after day, each with his and her secret and selfish thought,
and blood strange to each other blood and strange to mine, and think that this seemed to be the only way 1 could get ready to stay dead, I would hate my father for having ever planted me. I would look forward to the
times when they faulted, so I could whip them. When the
switch fell I could feel it upon my flesh; w^hen it welted
and ridged it was my blood that ran, and I would thinl)
i62 AS I LAY DYING
witli each blow of the switch: Now you are aware of me!
Now I am something in your secret and selfish life, who
have marked your blood with my own for ever and
ever. And so I took Anse. I saw him pass die school-house
three or four times before I learned that he was driving
four miles out of his way to do it. I noticed dien how he was beginning to hump—a tall man and young—so that he looked already like a tall bird hunched in the cold
weather, on the wagon-seat. He would pass die schoolhouse,
the wagon creaking slow, his head turning slow to watch the door of the school-house as the wagon passed,
until he went on around the cuive and out of sight. One
day I went to the door and stood there when he passed.
When he saw me he looked quickly away and did not
look back again. In the early spring it was worst. Sometimes I thought
that I could not bear it, lying in bed at night, with the
wild geese going north and their honking coming faint and high and wild out of the wild darkness, and during
the day it would seem as though I couldn’t wait for the
last one to go so I could go down to the spring. And so when I looked up that day and saw Anse standing
there in his Sunday clothes, turning his hat round and
round in his hands, I said:
“If youVe got any womenfolks, why in the world don’t
they make you get your hair cut?”
“I ain’t got none,” he said. Then he said suddenly,
driving his eyes at me like two hounds in a strange yard:
“That’s what I come to see you about.”
“And make you hold your shoulders up,” I said. “You
haven’t got any? But you’ve got a house. They teU me
you’ve got a house and a good farm. And you live there
AS I LAY DYING 4^3
alone, doing for yourself, do you?’' He just looked at me,
turning the hat in his hands. ‘‘A new house,” I said. ''Are you going to get married?”
And he said again, holding his eyes to mine: 'That’s what I come to see you about.”
Later he told me, '1 ain’t got no people. So that won’t
be no worry to you. I don’t reckon you can say the
same.”
"No. I have people. In JefiEerson.” His face fell a little. "Well, I got a httle property. I’m
forehanded; I got a good honest name. I know how town
folks are, but maybe when they talk to me . . .” "They might hsten,” I said. "But they’ll be hard to talk
to.” He was watching my face. "They’re in the cemetery.”
"But your living kin,” he said. "They’U be different.” "Will they?” I said. "I don’t know. I never had any
other kind.”
So I took Anse. And when I knew that I had Cash, I knew that living was terrible and that this was tlie an- swer to it. That was when I learned that words are no
good; that words don’t ever fit even what they are trying
to say at. When he was bom I knew that motherhood was invented by someone who had to have a word for it because the ones that had the children didn’t care whether there was a word for it or not. I knew that fear was invented by someone that had never had the fear;
pride, who never had the pride. I knew that it had been,
not that they had dirty noses, but that we had had to use one anotlier by words like spiders dangling by theii mouths from a beam, swinging and twisting and never
touching, and that only through the blows of the switch
could my blood and their blood flow as one stream. ) knew that it had been, not that my aloneness had to be-
4^4 AS I LAY DYING
violated over and over each day, but that it had never been violated until Cash came. Not even by Anse in the
nights.
He had a word, too. Love, he called it. But I had been
used to words for a long time. I knew that that word
was like the otliers: just a shape to fill a lack; that when
the right time came, you wouldn't need a word for that
any more than for pride or fear. Cash did not need to
sa)^ it to me nor I to him, and I would say, Let Anse use
it, if he wants to. So that it was Anse or love; love or Anse: it didn't matter.
I would think that even while I lay with him in the
dark and Cash asleep in the cradle within the swing of my hand. I would think that if he were to wake and cry,
I would suckle him, too. Anse or love: it didn’t matter. My aloneness had been violated and then made whole
again by the violation: time, Anse, love, what you will,
outside the circle. Then I found that I had Dari. At first I would not believe
it. Then I believed that I would kill Anse. It was
as though he had tricked me, hidden within a w ord like within a paper screen and struck me in the baci tlirough
it. But then I realized that I had been tricked hy words
older than Anse or love, and that the same woid had
tricked Anse too, and that my revenge would be tlrat he
would never know I was taking revenge. And when Dari was born I asked Anse to promise to take me back to
Jefferson when I died, because I knew that father had
been right, even when he couldn’t have known he was
right any more than I could have known I was wrong.
''Nonsense,” Anse said; 'you and me ain’t nigh done
chapping yet, with just two.”
He did not know that he was dead, then. Sometimes I
AS I LAY DYING 465
would lie by him in the dark, hearing the land that was now of my blood and flesh, and I would think: Anse.
Why Anse. Why are you Anse. I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquefy and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out of the darkness into the
vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a signifi- cant shape profoundly without life hke an empty door
frame; and then I would find that I had forgotten the name of the jar. I would think: The shape of my body
where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a and I couldn’t think Anse, couldn’t remember Anse, It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin,
because I was three now. And when I would think
Cash and Dari that way until their names would die and
solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what they
call them.
And so when Cora Tull would teU me I was not a true mother, I would think how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing
goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while
the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and
fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor
loved nor feared have for what they never had and cam
not have until they forget the words. Like Cora, who
could never even cook.
She would tell me what I owed to my children and to Anse and to God. I gave Anse the children. I did not ask
for them. I did not even ask him for what he could have
given me: not-Anse. That was my duty to him, to not
ask that, and that duty I fulfilled. I would be I; I would
466 AS I LAY DYING
let him be the shape and echo of his woid. That was
more than he asked, because he could not have asiced tor that and been Anse, using himself so with a word.
And then he died. He did not know he was dead. I would lie by him in tire dark, hearing the dark land
talking of Gods love and His beauty and His sin; hearing the dark voicelessness in which the words are the
deeds, and the other words that are not deeds, that are
just the gaps in peoples’ lacks, coming down like the
cries of the geese out of the wild darkness in the old ter- rible nights, fumbhng at the deeds like orphans to whom
are pointed out in a crowd two faces and told, That is your father, your mother.
I believed that I had found it. I believed that the rea- son was the duty to the alive, to the terrible blood, the
ted bitter flood boiling through the land. I WDuld think
of sin as I would think of the clothes we both wore in the world’s face, of the circumspection necessary be- cause he was he and I was I, the sin the more utter and
terrible since he was the instrument ordained hy God
who created the sin, to sanctify tliat sin He had created. While I waited for him in tire woods, waiting for him before
he saw me, I would think of him as dressed in sin. I would think of him as thinking of me as dressed also in
sin, he the more beautiful since the garment which he
had exchanged for sin was sanctified. I would think of the sin as garments which we would remove in order to shape and coerce the terrible blood to the forlorn echo of the dead word high in the air. Then I would lay with
Anse again—I did not lie to him: I just refused, just as
I refused my breast to Cash and Dari after their time was up—^hearing the dark land talking the voiceless speech.
I hid nothing. I tried to deceive no one. I would not have cared. I merely took the precautions that he thouglit
AS I LAY DYING 4^7
necessaiy for his sake, not for my safety, but just as I wore clothes m tlie world's face. And I would think then
when Cora talked to me, of how the high dead words in time seemed to lose even the significance of their dead
sound.
Then it was over. Over in the sense that he was gone
and I knew that, see him again though I would, I would
never again see him coming swift and secret to me in the
woods dressed in sin like a gallant garment alread}^ blowing
aside with the speed of his secret coming.
But for me it was not over. I mean, over in the sense
of beginning and ending, because to me there was no be- ginning nor ending to anything then. I even held Anse re training still, not that I was holding him recessional, bul
as though nothing else had ever been. My children w^ere
of me alone, of the wild blood boiling along the earth, of me and of all that lived; of none and of all. Then > found that I had Jewel. When I waked to remember to discover it, he was two months gone.
My father said that the reason for living is getting
ready to stay dead. I knew at last what he meant and
that he could not have known what he meant himself,
because a man cannot know anything about cleaning up
the house afterward. And so I have cleaned my house.
With Jewel—I lay by the lamp, holding up my own
head, watching him cap and suture it before he breathed —the wild blood boiled away and the sound of it ceased. Then there was only the milk, warm and cahn, and I lying calm in the slow silence, getting ready to clean my
house.
I gave Anse Dewey Dell to negative Jewel. Then I gave
him Vardaman to replace the child I had robbed him of, And now he has three children that are his and not mine.
And then I could get ready to die.
468 AS I LAY DYING
One day I was talking to Cora. She prayed for me be- cause she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel
and pray too, because people to whom sin is just a matter
of words, to them salvation is just words too. WHITFIELD
WHEN THEY TOLD ME SHE WAS DYING, ALL THAT NIGHT
I wrestled with Satan, and I emerged victorious. 1 woke to the enormity of my sin; I saw the true hght at
last, and I fell on my knees and confessed to God and
asked his guidance and received it. “Rise,’’ He said; “re- pair to tliat home in which you have put a living lie, among those people with whom you have outraged My
Word; confess your sin aloud. It is for them, for that deceived
husband, to forgive you: not I.” So I went I heard that Tull’s bridge was gone; I said
“Thanks, O Lord, O Mighty Ruler of all”; for by those
dangers and diflBculties which I should have to suimount
I saw that He had not abandoned me; that my reception
again into His holy peace and love would be the sweeter
for it. ‘7^st let me not perish before I have begged the
forgiveness of the man whom I betrayed,” I prayed;
“let me not be too late; let not the tale of mine and her
transgression come from her lips instead of mine. She had
sworn then that she would never tell it, but eternity is a fearsome thing to face: have I not wrestled thigh to thigh
with Satan myself? let me not have also the sin of her
AS I LAY DYING 4^9
broken vow upon my soul. Let not the w^aters of Thy
mighty wrath encompass me until I have cleansed my
soul in the presence of them whom I injured,”
It was His hand that bore me safely above the flood, that fended from me the dangers of the waters. My horse was frightened, and my own heart failed me as the logs
and the uprooted trees bore down upon my littleness. But
not my soul: time after time I saw tliem averted at destruction’s
final instant, and I lifted my voice above the
noise of the flood: “Praise to thee, O Mighty Lord and
King. By this token shall I cleanse my soul and gain
again into the fold of Thy undying love.”
I knew then that forgiveness was mine. The flood, the
danger, behind, and as I rode on across the firm earth
again and the scene of my Gethsemane drew closer and
closer, I framed the words which I should use. I would
enter the house; I would stop her before she had spoken;
I would say to her husband; “Anse, I have sinned. Do
with me as you will.” It was already as though it were done. My soul felt freer, quieter than it had in years; already I seemed to dwell in abiding peace again as I rode on. To either side
I saw His hand; in my heart I could hear His voice;
“Courage. I am with thee.” Then I reached Tull’s house. His youngest girl came
out and called to me as I was passing. She told me that
she was already dead.
I have sinned, O Lord. Thou knowest the extent of my
remorse and the will of my spirit. But He is merciful; He
will accept the will for the deed. Who knew that when I framed the words of my confession it was to Anse I spoke them, even though he was not there. It was He in His infinite vdsdom that restrained the tale from her dying
lips as she lay surrounded by those who loved and
470 AS I XAY DYING
trusted her; mine the travail by water which I sustained
by the sii-ength of His hand. Praise to Tliee in Thy
bounteous and omnipotent love; 0 praise.
I entered the house of bereavement, the lowly dwelling
v/here another erring mortal lay while her soul faced the
awful and irrevocable judgment, peace to her ashes.
‘"God’s grace upon this house,” I said. DARL

N THE HORSE HE RODE UP TO ARMSTID S AND GAME
back on the horse, leading Armstids team. We
hitched up and laid Cash on top of Addie. When we laid him down he vomited again, but he got his head over the
wagon bed in time. ''He taken a lick in the stomach too/’ Vemon said. "The horse may have kicked him in the stomach too/’
I said. '‘Did he kick you in the stomach, Cash?”
He tried to say something. Dewey Dell wiped his mouth again.
"What’s he say?” Vernon said. "What is it. Cash?” Dewey Dell said. She leaned down.
"His tools,” she said. Vernon got them and put them into
the wagon. Dewey Dell lifted Cash’s head so he could
see. We drove on, Dewey Dell and I sitting beside Cash
to steady him and he riding on ahead on the horse. Ver- non stood watching us for a while. Then he tuiT^ed and
went back toward the bridge. He walked gingerly, be-
AS I LAY LYING 471
ginning to flap the wet sleeves of Lis sLirt as though he
had just got wet. He was sitting the horse before the gate. Armstid was
waiting at the gate. We stopped and he got down and we
lifted Cash down and carried him into the house, where
Mrs. Armstid had tlie bed ready. We left her and Dewey
Dell undressing him.
We followed pa out to the wagon. He went back and
got into the wagon and drove on, we following on foot, into the lot. The wetting had helped, because Armstid
said, ‘'You welcome to tlie house. You can put it there.” He followed, leading the horse, and stood beside the
wagon, the reins in his hand.
“I thank you,” pa said. "Well use in the shed yonder.
I know it's a imposition on you.”
"You’re welcome to the house,” Armstid said. He had
that wooden look on his face again; that bold, surly, high--
coloured rigid look like his face and eyes were two coU
ours of wood, the wrong one pale and the wrong one
dark. His shirt was beginning to dry, but it still clung
close upon him when he moved.
"She would appreciate it,” pa said. We took the team out and rolled the wagon back un- der the shed. One side of the shed was open.
"It won’t rain under,” Armstid said. "But if you’d
rather . . Back of the barn was some rusted sheets of tin roofing.
We took two of them and propped them against the
open side. "You’re welcome to the house,” Armstid said. "I thank you,” pa said. "I’d take it right kind if you’d
give them a little snack.”
"Sho,” Armstid said. "Lula’U have supper ready soon ar she gets Cash comfortable.” He had gone back to the
472 AS I LAY DYING
horse and he was taking the saddle off, his damp shirt lapping flat to him when he moved.
Pa wouldn’t come in the house.
^‘Come in and eat/" Armstid said. 'It’s nigh ready/’
T wouldn’t crave nothing,” pa said. "I thank you.”
^Tfou come in and dry and eat,” Armstid said. "It’ll be
all right here.”
"It’s for her,” pa said. "It’s for her sake I am taking the
food. I got no team, no nothing. But she wiU be grateful to ere a one of you.”
"Sho,” Aimstid said. "You folks come in and dry.”
But after Armstid gave pa a drink, he felt better, and
when we went in to see about Cash he hadnt come in With us. When I looked back he was leading the horse
into the barn he was already talking about getting an- other team, and by supper time he had good as bought
it He is down there in the barn, sliding fluidly past the
gaudy lunging swirl, into the stall with it. He climbs on
to the manger and drags the hay down and leaves the
stall and seeks and finds the curry-comb. Then he returns and slips quickly past the single crashing thump and up
against the horse, where it cannot over-reach. He applies
the curry-comb, holding himself within the horse's strik- ing radius with the agility of an acrobat, cursing the horse
in a whisper of obscene caress. Its head flashes back,
tooth-cropped; its eyes roll in the dusk like marbles on a gaudy velvet cloth as he strikes it upon the face with the
back of the curry-comb.

B
ut tinue i give him another sup of whisky ant
supper was about ready, he had done already
bought a team from somebody, on a credit. Picking and
choosing he were by tlien, saying how he didn’t like this span and wouldn’t put his money in nothing so-and-so
owned, not even a hen coop.
'Tou might try Snopes,” I said. “He’s got three-foui span. Maybe one of them would suit you.”
Then he begun to mumble his mouth, looking at me
like it was me that owned the only span of mules in the
country and wouldn’t sell them to him, when I knew
that like as not it would be my team that would ever get
them out of the lot at all. Only I don’t know what they
would do with them, if they had a team. Littlejohn had
told me that the levee through Haley bottom had done
gone for two miles and that the only way to get to Jef- ferson would be to go around by Mottson. But that was
Anse’s business.
“He’s a close man to trade with,” he says, mumbling
his mouth. But when I give him another sup after supper,
he cheered up some. He was aiming to go back to the
barn and set up with her. Maybe he thought that if he
just stayed down there ready to take out, Santa Claus
would maybe bring him a span of mules. “But I reckon I can talk him around,” he says. “A man’ll always help a
fellow in a tight, if he’s got ere a drop of Christian blood
in him.”
“Of course you’re welcome to the use of mine,” I said 473
474 AS I LAY DYING
me knowing how much he believed that was the reason.
"I thank you,” he said. “Shell want to go in oum,” and
him knowing how much I believed that was the reason. After supper Jewel rode over to the Bend to get Peabody.
I heard he was to be there today at Varner's. Jewel come back about midnight. Peabody had gone down below
Inverness somewhere, but Uncle BiUy come back
with him, with his satchel of horse-physic. Like he says, a man ain't so different from a horse or a mule, come
long come short, except a mule or a horse has got a little more sense. “What you been into now, boy?” he says, looking at Cash. “Get me a mattress and a chair and a
glass of whisky,” he says. He made Cash drink the whisky, then he run Anse
out of the room. "Xucky it was the same leg he broke last summer,” Anse says, mournful, mumbling and blinking.
^That's something.”
We folded the mattress across Cashs legs and set the
chair on the mattress and me and Jewel set on the chair
and the gal held the lamp and Uncle Billy taken a chew
of tobacco and went to work. Cash fought pretty hard for a while, until he fainted. Then he laid still, with big balls of sweat standing on his face like they had started to roll down and then stopped to wait for him.
When he waked up. Uncle Billy had done packed up
and left. He kept on trying to say something until the gal
leaned down and wiped his mouth. “Its his tools,” she
said.
“I brought them in,” Dari said. “I got them.”
He tried to talk again; she leaned down. “He wants to see them,” she said. So Dari brought them in where he
could see them. They shoved them under the side of the
bed, where he could reach his hand and touch them when
he felt better. Next morning Anse taken tliat horse and
AS I LAY DYING 47J
rode over to the Bend to see Snopes. Him and Jewel
stood in tlie lot talking a while, then Anse got on the
horse and rode off. I reckon that was the first time Jewel
ever let anybody ride that horse, and until Anse come
back he hung around in tliat swole-up way, watching the
road like he was half a mind to take out after Anse and
get tiic horse back. 0 > Along toward nine o’clock it begun to get hot. That was when I see the first buzzard. Because of the wetting,
1 reckon. Anyway it wasn't until well into the day that 1 see them. Lucky the breeze was setting away from the
house, so it wasn’t until well into the morning. But soon
as I see them it was like I could smell it in the field a
mile away fiom just watching them, and then circling
and circling for everybody in the county to see what
was in my bain.
I was still a good half a mile from the house when I heard that boy yelling. I thought maybe he might have
fell into the well or something, so I whipped up and come
into the lot on the lope.
There must have been a dozen of them setting along
tlie ridge-pole of the barn, and that boy was chasing
another one around tlie lot like it was a turkey and it just lifting enough to dodge him and go flopping back to the roof of tlie shed again where he had found it setting on the cofiin. It had got hot then, right, and the breeze
had dropped or changed or something, so I went and
found Jewel, but Lula come out. ^‘You got to do something,” she said. ‘It's a outrage.”
‘'That's what I aim to do,” I said.
‘It's a outage,” she said. “He should be lawed for treat- ing her so.” “He's gctling her into the ground the best he can ” 1 said. So I found Jewel and asked him if he didn't want
47^ AS I LAY BYIIS-G
to take one of the mules and go over to the Bend and
see about Anse. He didn't say nothing. He just looked at me with his jaws going bone-white and them bone-white
eyes of hisn, then he went and begun to call Dark
“What you fixing to do?" I said. He didn’t answer. Dari come out. “Come on” Jewel
said. "“What }/ou aim to do?” Dari said. “Going to move the wagon/’ Jewel said over his shoulder.“Don’t
be a fool,” I said. “I never meant nothing. You
couldn’t help it.” And Dari hung back too, but nothing
wouldn’t suit Jewel.
“Shut your goddamn mouth,” he says.
“It’s got to be somewhere,” Dari said. “Well take out soon as pa gets back.”
“You won’t help me?” Jewel says, them white eyes of
hisn kind of blaring and his face shaking like he had a
aguer.
“No,” Dari said. “I won’t. Wait till pa gets back.”
So I stood in the door and watched him push and haul
at that wagon. It was on a downhill, and once I thought
he was fixing to beat out the back end of tire shed. Then
the dinner-bell rung. I called him, but he didn’t look
around. “Come on to dinner,” I said. “Tell that boy.”
But he didn’t answer, so I went on to dinner. The gal
went down to get that boy, but she come back without
him. About half through dinner we heard him yelling
again, running that buzzard out.
“It’s a outrage,” Lula said; “a outrage.”
“He’s doing the best he can,” I said. ""A fellow don’t
trade with Snopes in thirty minutes. They’ll set in the
shade all afternoon to dicker.” “Do?” she savs “Do? He’s done too much, already.”
AS I IjAY dying 477
And I reclvon he had. Trouble is, his quitting was just
about to start our doing. He couldn t buy no team from
nobody, let alone Snopes, withouten he had something
to mortgage he didn’t know would mortgage yet. And
so when I v^ent back to the field I looked at my mules
and same as told them good-bye for a spell. And when I come back that evening and the sun shining all day on
that shed, I wasn’t so sho I would regret it. He come riding up just as I went out to the porch,
where they all was. He looked kind of funny: kind of more hang-dog than common, and kind of proud too. Like he had done something he thought was cute but
wasn’t so sho now how other folks would take it. ‘T got a team,” he said. ‘"You bought a team from Snopes?” I said. ‘T reckon Snopes ain’t the only man in this country that can drive a trade,” he said,
"'Sho,” I said. He was looking at Jewel, with tliat funny
look, but Jewel had done got down from the porch and was going toward the horse. To see what Anse had done
to it, I reckon.
‘‘Jewel,” Anse says. Jewel looked back. “Come here,’' Anse says. Jewel come back a little and stopped again.
“What you want?” he said. “So you got a team from Snopes,” I said. “He’ll send
them over tonight, I reckon? You’ll want a early start to- morrow, long as you’ll have to go by Mottson.”
Then he quit looking like he had been for a while. He
got that badgered look like he used to have, mumbling
his mouth.
“I do the best I can,’ he said. “’Fore God, if there were ere a man in the living world suft'ered the trials and
floutmgs I have suffered.” “A fellow that just beat Snopes in a trade ought to
47S AS I LAY DYING
feel pretty good/’ I said. ^What did you give him, Anse?’' He didn’t look at me. give a chattel mortgage on my
cultivator and seeder/’ he said. "But they ain’t worth forty dollars. How far do you
aim to get with a forty-dollar team?”
Tliey were all watching him now, quiet and steady.
Jewel was stopped, half-way back, waiting to go on to the horse. "I give other things,” Anse said. He begun to mumble his mouth again, standing there like he was
waiting for somebody to hit him and him with his mind
already made up not to do nothing about it. ‘What other things?” Dari said. "Hell,” I said. "You take my team. You can bring them
back. Ill get along some way.”
"So that’s what you were doing in Cash’s clothes last night,” Dari said. He said it just like he w^as reading it oufcen the paper. Like he never give a dum himself one way or tlie other. Jewel had come back now, standing
there, looking at Anse with them marble eyes of hisn. "Cash aimed to buy that talking machine from Suratt with that money,” Dari said. Anse stood there, mumbling his mouth. Jewel watched
him. He ain’t never blinked yet.
"But that’s just eight dollars more,” Dari said, in that
voice like he was just listening and never give a dum
himself. "That still won’t buy a team.”
Anse looked at Jewel quick, kind of sliding his eyes
that way, then he looked down again. "God knows, if there were ere a man,” he says. Still they didn’t say nothing.
They just watched him, waiting, and him sliding his eyes toward their feet and up their legs but no higher.
‘And the horse,” he says. ‘What horse?” Jewel said. Anse just stood tliere. I be
dum, if a man can’t keep the upper hand of his sons, he
AS I LAY DYIjSTG 479
ought to run them away from home, no matter how big
they are. And if he can t do that, I be dum if he oughtn’t
to leave himself. I be dum if I wouldn’t. ‘You mean, you
tried to swap my horse?” Jewel says. Anse stands diere, dangle-armed. “For fifteen years I
^ ain’t had a tooth in my head,” he says. “God knows it. He
knows in fifteen years I ain’t et the victuals He aimed for man to eat to keep liis strength up, and me saving a
nickel here and a nickel there so my family wouldn’t suf- fer it, to buy them teeth so I could eat God’s appointed
food. I give that money. I thought that if I could do
without eating, my sons could do without riding. God
knows I did.”
Jewel stands with his hands on his hips, looking at Anse. Then he looks away. He looked out across the
field, his face still as a rock, like it was somebody else talking about somebody else’s horse and him not even lis- tening. Then he spit, slow, and said “Hell” and he turned
and went on to the gate and unhitched the horse and got on it. It was moving when he come into the saddle and
by the time he was on it they was tearing down the road
hke the Law might have been behind them. They went
out of sight that way, the two of them looking like some
kind of a spotted cyclone.
‘WeU,” I says. “You take my team,” I said. But ha
wouldn’t do it. And they wouldn’t even stay, and that boy chasing them buzzards all day in the hot sun unti]
he was nigh as crazy as the rest of them. ‘Xeave Cash
here, anyway,” I said. But they wouldn’t do that. They
made a pallet for him with quilts on top of the coflBn and
laid him on it and set his tools by him, and we put m^
team in and hauled the wagon about a mile down the
road.
“If we’U bother you here,” Anse says, “just say so.”
480 AS I LAT DYING
"Sho,” I said. "It'll be fine here. Safe, too. Now let's go
back and eat supper."
"I thank you," Anse said. "We got a little something in the basket. We can make out." "Where'd you get it?” I said. "'We brought it from home.”
"But it'll be stale now," I said. "Come and get some hot
victuals." But they wouldn’t come. "I reckon we can make out,"
Anse said. So I went home and et and taken a basket
back to them and tried again to make them come back
to the house.
"I thank you," he said. "I reckon we can make out.” So
I left them there, squatting aroimd a little fire, waiting;
God knows what for.
I come on home. I kept thinking about them there,
and about that fellow tearing away on that horse. And
that would be the last they would see of him. And I be
durn if I could blame him. Not for wanting to not give
up his horse, but for getting shut of such a durn fool as Anse.
Or that's what I thought then. Because be dum if there
ain't something about a dum fellow like Anse that seems
to make a man have to help him, even when he knows
he'll be wanting to kick himself next minute. Because
about a hour after breakfast next morning Eustace
Grimm that works Snopes' place come up with a span of
mules, hunting Anse.
"I thought him and Anse never traded,” I said. "Sho,” Eustace said. "All they liked was the horse. Like
I said to Mr. Snopes, he was letting this team go for fifty
dollars, because if his uncle Flem had a just kept them
Texas horses when he owned them, Anse wouldn't
a-never-
AS I LAY BYIISTG 481
‘The horse?” I said. “Anse’s boy taken that horse and
cleared out last nighty probably half-way to Texas by
now, and Anse
”
‘T didn't know who brung it,” Eustace said. T never
see them. I just found the horse in the bam this morning
when I went to feed, and I told Mr. Snopes and he said to bring the team on over here.” Well, that’ll be the last they’ll ever see of him now, sho
enough. Come Christmas time they’ll maybe get a postal
card from him in Texas, I reckon. And if it hadn’t a been
Jewel, I reckon it’d a been me; I owe him that much, myself.
I be dum if Anse don’t conjure a man, some way. I be durn if he ain’t a sight.

He looks up. We watch tbem in little tall black circles of not-moving.

piece of wood under his knee.

supper time.
“It’s because she wouldn’t have us beholden,” pa says.
“ ’Fore God, I do the best that ere a man.” Is it because
JeweTs mother is a horse, Dari? I said,
“Maybe I can draw the ropes a little tighter,” Dari says. That's why Jewel and I were both in the shed and she was in the wagon because the horse lives in the barn and
I had to keep on running the buzzard away from

"No/’ Cash says. “Ain’t no time to hang back. It don’t bother none.”
"We'll have to get some medicine at Mottson,” pa says.
."I reckon we’ll have to.” "Tell him to go on,” Cash says. We go on. Dewey Dell
leans back and wipes Cash’s face. Cash is my brother. But JeiveTs mother is a horse. My mother is a fish, Dari
says that when we come to the water again I might see her and Dewey Dell said, She's in the box; hotv could
she have got out? She got out through the holes 1 bored,

"Why did he feed them on sawdust, Dari?” I say. "Look,” Dari says. "See?”

MOSELEY
I
HAPPENED TO LOOK UP, AND SAW HER OUTSIDE THE WINdow,
looking in. Not close to the glass, and not look- ing at anything in particular; just standing there with her
head turned this way and her eyes full on me and kind
of blank too, like she was waiting for a sign. When I looked up again she was moving toward the door.
She kind of bumbled at the screen door a minute, hke
they do, and came in. She had on a stiff-brimmed straw
hat setting on the top of her head and she was carrying a package wrapped in newspaper: I drought drat she had
a quarter or a dollar at tire most, and that after she stood
around awhile she would maybe buy a cheap comb or a bottle of nigger toilet water, so I never disturbed her
for a minute or so except to notice that she was pretty
in a kind of sullen, awkward way, and that she looked a
sight better in her gingham dress and her own complexion
dran she would after she bought whatever she would
finally decide on. Or tell that she wanted. I knew that
she had already decided before she came in. But you
have to let them take their time. So I went on with what
I was doing, figuring to let Albert wait on her when he
caught up at the fountain, when he came back to me.
“That woman,” he said. 'Tfou better see what she
wants.”
"What does she want?” I said. “I don t know. I cant get anything out of her. You
better wait on her.” So 1 went around the counter. I saw that she was
484
AS I LAY DYING 485
barefooted, standing with her feet flat and easy on the
floor, like she was used to it. She was looking at me, hard,
holding the package; I saw she had about as black a pair
of eyes as ever I saw, and she was a stranger. I never re- membered seeing her in Mottson before. “What can I do
for you?” I said.
Still she didn’t say anything. She stared at me witliout winking. Then she looked back at the folks at the fountain.
Then she looked past me, toward the back of the
store. “Do you want to look at some toilet things?” I said
“Or is it medicine you want?”
“That’s it,” she said. She looked quick back at the fountain
again. So I thought maybe her ma or somebody had
sent her in for some of this female dope and she was
ashamed to ask for it. I knew she couldn’t have a complexion
like hers and use it herself, let alone not being
much more than old enough to barely know what it was
for. It’s a shame, the way they poison themselves with it. But a man’s got to stock it or go out of business in this country.
“Oh,” I said. “What do you use? We have She
looked at me again, almost like she had said hush, and
looked toward the back of the store again.
“I’d hefer go back there,” she said. “All right,” I said. You have to humour them. You save time by it. I followed her to the back. She put her hand
on the gate. “There’s nothing back there but the prescription
case,” I said. “What do you want?” She stopped
and looked at me. It was like she had taken some kind of a lid oflE her face, her eyes. It was her eyes: kind of dumb
and hopeful and sullenly willing to be disappointed all at the same time. But she was in trouble of some sort; I could see that. “What’s your trouble?” I said. “Tell me
486 AS I LAY BYIKG
what it is you want. Tm pretty busy."' I wasn't meaning to hurry her, but a man just hasn't got the time they have
out there.
“It's the female trouble,’' she said. “Oh," I said. “Is that all?" I thought maybe she was
younger than she looked, and her first one had scared
her, or maybe one had been a little abnormal as it will in young women. “Where’s your ma?’' I said. “Haven't you
got one?"
“She's out yonder in the wagon," she said. WVhy not talk to her about it before you take any medicine,"
I said. “Any woman would have told you about
it." She looked at me, and I looked at her again and said,
“How old are you?"
“Seventeen," she said. “Oh," I said. “I thought maybe you were . . She was
watching me. But then, in the eyes all of them look like they had no age and knew everything in the world, anyhow.
“Are you too regular, or not regular enough?"
She quit looking at me but she didn't move. “Yes," she
said. “I reckon so. Yes." “Well, which?” I said. “Don't you know?" It's a crime
and a shame; but after all, they’U buy it from somebody.
She stood there, not looking at me. “You want something
to stop it?" I said. “Is that it?” “No,” she said. “That's it. It's already stopped."
^Well, what Her face was lowered a little, still, like they do in all their dealings with a man so he don't ever know just where the lightning will strike next. "TTou are not married, are you?” I said. “No."
“Oh," I said. “And how long has it been since it Btopped? about five months maybe?”
*lt ain't been but two " she said.
AS 1 LAY DYING 487
'Well, I haven’t got anything in my store you want to buy,” I said, 'unless it’s a nipple. And Td advise you to buy that and go back home and tell your pa, if you have
one, and let him make somebody buy you a wedding li- cence. Was that all you wanted?”
But she just stood there, not looking at me.
"I got the money to pay you,” she said.
"Is it your own, or did he act enough of a man to give
you the money?”
"He give it to me. Ten dollars. He said that would be
enough.”
"A thousand dollars wouldn’t be enough in my store and ten cents wouldn’t be enough,” I said. "You take my
advice and go home and tell you pa or your brothers if you have any or the first man you come to in the road.” But she didn’t move. "Lafe said I could get it at the
drug-store. He said to tell you me and him wouldn’t
never tell nobody you sold it to us.” "And I just wish your precious Lafe had come for it himself; that’s what I wish. I don’t know: I’d have had
a little respect for him then. And you can go back and tell him I said so—if he ain’t half-way to Texas by now, which
I don’t doubt. Me, a respectable druggist, that’s kept
store and raised a family and been a church-member
for fifty-six years in this tovm. I’m a good mind to tell your folks myself, if I can just find who they are.” She looked at me now, her eyes and face kind of blank
again like when I first saw her through the window. "I didn’t know,” she said. "He told me I could get something
at the drug-store. He said they might not want to
sell it to me, but if I had ten dollars and told them I wouldn’t never tell nobody . . "He never said this drug-store,” I said. "If he did ot mentioned my name, I defy him to prove it, I defy him
4-88 AS I LAY DYING
to repeat it or TU prosecute kim to the full extent of the
law, and you can tell him so.” ''But maybe another drug-store would,” she said. "Then I don’t want to know it. Me, that’s ” Then I looked at her. But it’s a hard life they have; sometimes
a man ... if there can ever be any excuse for sin, which
it can’t be. And then, life wasn’t made to be easy on folks: they wouldn’t ever had any reason to be good and die. "Look here,” I said. "You get that notion out of your head.
The Lord gave you what you have, even if He did use
the devil to do it; you let Him take it away from you if
it’s His will to do so. You go on back to Lafe and you
and him take that ten dollars and get married with it.” "Lafe said I could get something at the drug-store,” she
said. "Then go and get it,” I said. "You won’t get it here.”
She went out, carrying the package, her feet making
a little hissing on the floor. She bumbled again at the
door and went out. I could see her through the glass going
on down the street. It was Albert told me about the rest of it. He said the
wagon was stopped in front of Grummet’s hardware store,
with the ladies all scattering up and down the street with
handkerchief to their noses, and a crowd of hard-nosed
men and boys standing around the wagon, listening to the marshal arguing with the man. He was a kind of tall, gaunted man sitting on the wagon, saying it was a public
street and he reckoned he had as much right there as anybody, and the marshal telling him he would have to move on; folks couldn’t stand it. It had been dead eight
days, Albert said. They came from some place out in Yoknapatawpha
county, trying to get to Jefferson with it. It must have been like a piece of rotten cheese coming into
AS I LAY DYING 489
an ant-hill, in that ramshackle wagon that Albert said
folks were scared would fall all to pieces before they
could get it out of town, with that home-made box and
another fellow with a broken leg lying on a quilt on top
of it, and the fatiier and a little boy sitting on the seat and the marshal trying to make them get out of town.
'It’s a public street,” the man says. “1 reckon we can
stop to buy something same as airy other man. We got
die money to pay for hit, and hit ain’t airy law that says
a man can’t spend his money where he wants.”
They had stopped to buy some cement. The other son was in Grummet’s, trying to make Grummet break
a sack and let him have ten cents’ worth, and finally
Grummet broke the sack to get him out. They wanted
the cement to fix the fellow’s broken leg, someway.
'Why, you’ll kill him,” the marshal said. "You’ll cause him to lose his leg. You take him on to a doctor, and you
get this thing buried soon as you can. Don’t you know
you’re liable to jail for endangering the public health?”
"We’re doing the best w’e can,” the father said. Then
he told a long tale about how they had to wait for the
wagon to come back and how the bridge was washed
away and how they went eight miles to another bridge
and it was gone too so they came back and swum the
ford and the mules got drowned and how they got an- other team and found that the road was washed out and
they had to come clean around by Mottson, and then
the one with the cement came back and told him to shut
up."We’ll be gone in a minute,” he told the marshal
"We never aimed to bother nobody,” the father said. "You take that fellow to a doctor,” the marshal told the one with the cement.
490 AS I LAY DYIKG
"I reckon he’s all right,” he said. "It ain’t that we’re hard-hearted,” the marshal said
'"But I reckon you can tell yourself how it is.” “Sho,” the other said. ‘"Well take out soon as Dewey
Dell comes back. She went to deliver a package.”
So they stood there with the folks backed ofiE with
handkerchiefs to their faces, until in a minute the girl came up with that newspaper package.
""Come on,” the one with the cement said, ""we’ve lost too much time.” So they got in the wagon and went on. And when I went to supper it still seemed hke I could
smell it. And the next day I met the marshal and I began
to sniff and said, ""Smell anything?”
""I reckon they’re in Jefferson by now,” he said.
""Or in jail. Well, thank the Lord it’s not our jail.” ""That’s a fact,” he said. DARL
T ere’s a place,” pa says, he pulls the team up
Jn and sits looking at the house. ""We could get some
Vi^'ater over yonder.”
""All right,” I say. ""You’ll have to borrow a bucket from
them, Dewey Dell.” ""God knows,” pa says. ""I wouldn’t be beholden, God
knows.”
""If you see a good-sized can, you might bring it,” I say. Dewey Dell gets down from the wagon, carrying the
AS I LAY DYIKG 491
package. ‘‘You had more trouble than you expected, selh ing those cakes in Mottson,” I say. How do our lives ravel out into the no-wind, no-sound, the weary gestures wearily
recapitulant: echoes of old compulsions with no-hand on no-strings: in sunset we fall into furious attitudes, dead
gestures of dolls. Cash broke Ms leg and now the sawdust
is running out. He is bleeding to death is Cash.
'1 wouldn't be beholden,” pa says. "God knows.”
"Then make some water yourself,” I say. "We can use
Cash's hat.” When Dewey Dell comes back the man comes with
her. Then he stops and she comes on and he stands there
and after a w^hile he goes back to the house and stands on
the porch, watching us. "\Ve better not try to lift Mm down,” pa says. "We can
fix it here.”
"Do you want to be lifted down, Cash?” I say. 'Won't we get to Jefferson tomorrow?” he says. He is watching us, his eyes interrogatory, intent, and sad. "I can last it out.”
"It'll be easier on you,” pa says. "It'll keep it from rub- bing togetlier.”
"I can last it,” Cash says. "We'll lose lime stopping.”
'We done bought the cement, now,” pa says. "I could last it,” Cash says. "It ain't but one more Jay,
It don’t bother to speak of.” He looks at us, his eyes
wide in Ms thin grey face, questioning. "It sets up so,” he
says. 'We done bought it now ” pa says. I mix the cement in the can, stirring the slow water
into the pale-green tliick coils. I bring the can to the
wagon where Cash can see. He lies on Ms back, his tMu
profile in silhouette, ascetic and profound against the
sky. "Does that look about right?” I say.
4^^ AS I LAY DYING
'‘You don’t want too much water, or it wont work
right/’ he says.
^'Is this too much?”
"Maybe if you could get a little sand/’ he says. 'It ain’t but one more day/’ he says. "It don’t bother me none.”
Vardaman goes back down the road to where we
crossed the branch and returns \vith sand. He pours it slowly into the thick coiling in the can. I go to the
wagon again.
"Does that look all right?”
"Yes/’ Cash says. "I could have lasted. It don’t bother
me none.”
We loosen the sphnts and pour the cement over his
leg, slow. "Watch out for it,” Cash says. "Don’t get none on it if you can help.”
"Yes,” I say. Dewey Dell tears a piece of paper from
the package and wipes the cement from the top of it as
it drips from Cash’s leg.
"How does that feel?”
"It feels fine,” he says. "It’s cold. It feels fine.” "If it’ll just help you,” pa says. "I asks your forgiveness.
I never forseen it no more than you.'^
"It feels fine,” Cash says.
If you could just ravel out into time. That would be
nice. It would be nice if you could just ravel out into
time.
We replace the splints, the cords, drawing them tight,
the cement in thick pale green slow surges among the
cords, Cash watching us quietly with that profound
questioning look.
"That’ll steady it,” I say. "Ay,” Cash says. "I’m obliged.”
Then we all turn on the wagon and watch him. He is
AS I LAY DYING 493
coming up the road behind us, wooden-backed, wooden
faced, moving only from his hips down. He comes up
without a word, with his pale rigid eyes in his high
sullen face, and gets into the wagon.
'‘Here s a hill,” pa says. "I reckon you’ll have to get out and walk.”

ARL and jewel and DEWEY DELL AND I ARE WALKING
up the hill behind the wagon. Jewel came back. He
came up the road and got into the wagon. He was walking.
Jewel hasn’t got a horse any more. Jewel is my
brother. Cash is my brother. Cash has a broken leg. We
JBxed Cash’s leg so it doesn’t hurt. Cash is my brother. Jewel is my brother too, but he hasn’t got a broken leg.
Now there are five of them, tall in little tall black
circles. “Where do they stay at night, Dari?” I say. “When we
stop at night in the barn, where do they stay?”
The hill goes oflE into the sky. Then the sun comes up
from behind the hill and the mules and the wagon and
pa walk on the sun. You cannot watch them, walking slov\^ on the sun. In Jefferson it is red on the track behind the
glass. The track goes shining round and round. Dewey
Dell says so. Tonight I am going to see where they stay while we
are in the barn.

T EWEL,” I SAY, ''whose SON ARE YOU?’’ tJ The breeze was setting up from the barn, so we
put her under tlie apple tree, where the moonlight can dapple the apple tree upon the long slumbering flanks within which now and then she talks in little trickling bursts of secret and murmurous bubbling. I took Vardaman
to listen. When we came I’p the cat leaped down
from it and flicked away with silver claw and silver eye
into the shadow.
“Your mother was a horse, but who was your father,
jewel?”
“You goddamn lying son of a bitch.” “Don’t call me that,” I say. “You goddamn lying son of a bitch.” “Don’t you call me that, Jewel.” In the tall moonlight
his eyes look hke spots of white paper pasted on a high
small football. After supper Cash began to sweat a little. “It’s getting a little hot,” he said. “It was the sun shining on it all day,
I reckon.”
“You want some water poured on it?” we say. “Maybe
that will ease it some.”
'Td be obliged,” Cash said. “It was the sun shining on
it, I reckon. I ought to thought and kept it covered.”
“We ought to thought,” we said. “You couldn’t have
suspicioned.”
“I never noticed it getting hot ” Cash said. “I ought to minded it.” 494

So we poured tte water over it His leg and foot below
the cement look like they had been boiled. "Does that

across the moon and the cat jumps down and runs and we can hear her inside the wood. "Hear?” Dari says, "Put your ear close.”
I put my ear close and I can hear her. Only I cant
tell what she is saying.
"What is she saying, Dari?” I say, "Who is she talking to?”"Shes talking to God” Dari says. "She is calling on Him to help her.” 'What does she want Him to do?” I say. "She wants Him to hide her away from the sight of man,” Dari says. 'Why does she want to hide her away from the sight of man, Dari?”
"So she can lay down her life,” Dari says.
49 ^ AS I LAY DYING
‘‘Why does she want to lay down her life, Dari?'' “Listen,” Dari says. We hear her. We hear her turn over on her side. “Listen,” Dari says. “She’s turned over,” I say. “She’s looking at me through
the wood.”
“Yes,” Dari says. “How can she see tlmough the wood, Dari?”
“Come,” Dari says. “We must let her be quiet. Come.”
“She can t see out there, because the holes are in the
top,” I say. “How can she see, Dari?”
“Let’s go see about Cash,” Daii says. And I saw something Dewey Dell told me noi to tell nobody.
Cash is sick in his leg. We fixed his leg this afternoon,
but he is sick in it again, lying on the bed. We pour water on his leg and tlien he feels fine. “1 feel fine,” Cash says. “I’m obliged to you
” ‘Try to get some sleep,” we say.
“I feel fine,” Cash says. “I’m obliged to you.”
And I saw something Dewey Dell told me not to tell nobody. It is not about pa and it is not about Cash and
it is not about Jewel and it is not about Dewey Dell and
it is not about me. Dewey Dell and I are going to sleep on the pallet. It
is on the back porch, where we can see the bam, and the moon shines on half of the pallet and we will lie half in the white and half in the black, with the moonlight on
our legs. And then I am going to see where they stay at night while we are in the bam. We are not in the barn to- night but I can see the barn and so I am going to find where they stay at night.
We lie on the pallet, with our legs in the moon.
“Look,” I say, “my legs look black. Your legs look black,
too.”
AS I LAY LYING 49?
‘‘Go to sleep,” Dewey Dell says.
JeflFerson is a far piece.
“Dewey Dell.”
“If it's not Christmas now, how will it be there?”
It goes round and round on the shining track. Theii
the track goes shining round and round.
“Will what be there?”
“That ti*ain. In the window.”
“You go to sleep. You can see tomorrow if it's there."' Maybe Santa Claus won't know they are town boys.
“Dewey Dell.” “You go to sleep. He ain't going to let none of them
town boys have it.” It was behind the window, red on the track, and the
track shining round and round. It made my heart hurt. And then it was pa and Jewel and Dari and Mr. Gilles- pie’s boy. Mr. Gillespie’s boy’s legs come down under his nightshirt. When he goes into the moon, his legs fuzz. They go on around the house toward the apple ti*ee. “What are they going to do, Dewey DeU?”
They went around the house toward the apple tree. “I can smell her,” I say. “Can you smell her, too?”
“Hush,” Dewey Dell says. “The wind’s changed. Go to
sleep.”
And so I am going to know where they stay at night
soon. They come around the house, going across the
yard in the moon, carrying her on their shoulders. They
carry her down to the barn, the moon shining flat and
quiet on her. Then they come back and go into the house
again. While they were in the moon, Mr. Gillespie's boy's
legs fuzzed. And then I waited and I said Dewey Dell?
and then I waited and then I went to find where they
stay at night and I saw something that Dewey Dell told me not to tell nobody.
DARL
A GAINST THE DARK DOORWAY HE SEEMS TO MATERIALIZE x \ out of darkness, lean as a racehorse in his underclothes
in the beginning of the glare. He leaps to the
ground with on his face an expression of furious unbelief.
He has seen me without even turning his head or his eyes
in which the glare swims like two small torches. “Come
on,” he says, leaping down the slope toward the bam.
For an instant longer he runs silver in the moonlight,
then he springs out like a flat figure cut cleanly from tin against an abrupt and soundless explosion as the whole
loft of the bam takes fire at once, as though it had been
stuffed with powder. The front, the conical fagade with
the square orifice of doorway broken only by the square
squat shape of the coflSn on the saw-horses hke a cubistic
bug, comes into relief. Behind me pa and Gillespie and
Mack and Dewey Dell and Vardaman emerge from the
house.
He pauses at the coflSn, stooping, looking at me, his face furious. Overhead the flames sound like thunder;
across us rushes a cool draught: there is no heat in it at
all yet, and a handful of chaff lifts suddenly and sucks
swiftly along the stalls where a horse is screaming.
“Quick,” I say; “the horses.” He glares a moment longer at me, then at the roof over- head, then he leaps toward the stall where the horse
screams. It plunges and kicks, the sound of the crashing
blows sucking up into the sound of the flames. They
sound like an interminable train crossing an endless tres- 498
AS I LAY DYING 49^
tie. Gillespie and Mack pass me, in knee-length nightshirts,
shouting, their voices thin and high and meaningless
and at the same time profoundly wild and sad: " . . COW’ . a . stall . . Gillespies nightshirt rushes ahead
of him on tire draft, ballooning about his hairy thighs.
The stall door has swung shut. Jewel thrusts it back
witli his buttocks and he appears, his back arched, the
muscles ridged through his garments as he drags the
horse out by its head. In the glare its eyes roll with soft,
fleet, wild opalme fire; its muscles bunch and run as it flings its head about, lifting Jewel clear of the ground. He
drags it on, slowlv, terrifically; again he gives me across
his shoulder a single glare furious and brief. Even when
they are clear of the barn the horse continues to fight
and lash backward toward the doorway until Gillespie
passes me, stark naked, his nightshirt wrapped about
the mule's head, and beats the maddened horse on out of the door. Jewel returns, running; again he looks dovm at the coffin.
But he comes on. "‘Where's cow?” he cries, passing me.
I follow him. In the stall Mack is struggling with the
other mule. When its head turns into the glare I can see the wild rolling of its eye too, but gt makes no sound. It just stands there, watcliing Mack over its shoulder, swinging
its hindquarters toward him whenever he approaches.
He looks back at us, his eyes and mouth three round
holes in his face on wdiich the freckles look like English
peas on a plate. His voice is thin, high, far away.
‘T can't do nothing. . . .” It is as though the sound
had been swept from liis lips and up and away, speaking
back to us from an immense distance of exhaustion.
Jewel slides past us; the mule whirls and lashes out, but
he has already gained its head. I lean to Mack's ear:
‘‘Nightshirt. Around his head.”
500 AS I LAY DYING
Mack stares at me. Then he rips the nightshirt off and
flings it over the mule’s head, and it becomes docile at once. Jewel is yelling at him: ''Cow? Cow?”
"Back ” Mack cries. "Last stall.” The cow watches us as we enter. She is backed into
the corner, head lowered, still chewing though rapidly.
But she makes no move. Jewel has paused, looking up,
and suddenly we watch the entire floor to the loft dis- solve. It just turns to fire; a faint litter of sparks rains
down. He glances about. Back under the trough is a
three-legged milking-stool. He catches it up and swings
it into the planking of the rear wall. He splinters a
plank, then another, a third; we tear the fragments
away. While we are stooping at the opening something
charges into us from behind. It is the cow; with a single
whistling breath she rushes between us and through the
gap and into the outer glare, her tail erect and rigid as a broom nailed upright Lo the end of her spine.
Jewel turns back into the barn. "Here,” I say; "Jewel!”
I grasp at him; he strikes my hand down. "You fool,” I
say, "don’t you see you can t make it back yonder?” The
hall-way looks like a searchlight turned into rain. "Come
on,” 1 say, "around this way.”
When we are through the gap he begins to run. "Jewel,”
I say, running. He darts around the corner. When I reach
it he has almost reached the next one, running against
the glare like that figure cut from tin. Pa and Gillespie
and Mack are some distance away, watching the bam,
pink against the darkness where for the time the moonlight
has been vanquished. "Catch him!” I cry; "stop him!”
When I reach the front, he is struggling with Gillespie;
ihe one lean in underclothes, the other stark naked. They
are like two figures in a Greek frieze, isolated out of all
v-eality by the red glare. Before I can reach them he has
AS i laAY DYING 501
struck Gillespie to the ground and turned and rum bacl^ into the bam.
The sound of it has become quite peaceful now, like the sound of the river did. We watch through the dis- solving proscenium of the doorway as Jewel runs crouching
to the far end of the coflBn and stoops to it. For an
instant he looks up and out at us through the rain of burning hay like a portiere of flaming beads, and I can
see his mouth shape as he calls my name.
“Jeweir' Dewey Dell cries; “J^weir’ It seems to me that
I now hear the accumulation of her voice through the
last five minutes, and I hear her scuffling and struggling
as pa and Mack hold her, screaming, "‘Jewel! Jewel!” But
he is no longer looking at us. We see his shoulders strain as he up-ends the coffin and slides it single-handed from
the saw-horses. It looms unbelievably tall, hiding him: I would not have believed that Addie Bundren would have
needed that much room to lie comfortable in; for another
instant it stands upright while the sparks rain on it in scattering bursts as though they engendered other sparks
from the contact. Then it topples forward, gaining mo- mentum, revealing Jewel and the sparks raining on him
too in engendering gusts, so that he appears to be en- closed in a thin nimbus of fire. Without stopping it over- ends and rears again, pauses, then crashes slowly forward
and through the curtain. This time Jewel is riding upon
it, clinging to it, until it crashes down and flings him for- ward and clear and Mack leaps forward into a thin smell
of scorching meat and slaps at the widening crimson^
edged holes that bloom like flowers in his undershirt.
VARDAMAN
WHEN I WENr TO FIND WHERE THEY STAY AT NIGHT, I saw something. They said, ‘Where is Daii? Where
did Dari go?’’
They carried her back under the apple tree. The barn was still red, but it wasn’t a barn now. It was
sunk down, and the red went swirling up. The barn went
swirling up in little red pieces, against tlie sky and the
stars so that the stars moved backward.
And then Cash was still awake. He turned his head
From side to side, with sweat on his face. “Do you want some more water on it, Cash?” Dewey
Dell said. Cash’s leg and foot turned black. We held the lamp
and looked at Cash’s foot and leg where it was black. “Your foot looks like a nigger’s foot, Cash,” I said,
“I reckon we’ll have to bust it oflE,” pa said. “What in the tarnation you put it on there for?” Mr.
Gillespie said. “I thought it would steady it some,” pa said. “I just
aimed to help him.”
They got the flatiron and the hammer. Dewey Dell
held tie lamp. They had to hit it hard. And then Cash
went to sleep.
“He’s asleep now,” I said. “It can’t hurt him while he’s asleep.”
It just cracked. It wouldn’t come off.
'It’ll take the hide, too,” Mr. Gillespie said. ‘‘Why in 502
AS I LAY DYING 503
the tarnation you put it on there? Didn't none of you
think to grease his leg first?” “I just aimed to help him,” pa said. “It was Dari put it
3> on.'Where is Dari?” they said. "Didn t none of you have more sense than that?” Mr,
Gillespie said. 'Td "a! thought he would, anyway.”
Jewel was lying on his face. His back was red. Dewey
Dell put the medicine on it. The medicine was made out
of butter and soot, to draw out the fire. Then his back was black. "Does it hurt. Jewel?” I said. "Your back looks like a
nigger s. Jewel,” I said. Cash’s foot and leg looked like a
nigger s. Then they broke it off. Cash’s leg bled. "You go on back and lay down,” Dewey Dell said. 'You ought to be asleep.”
'Where is Dari?” they said. He is out there under the apple tree with her, lying on her. He is there so the cat won’t come back. I said,
"Are you going to keep the cat away, Dari?”
The moonlight dappled on him too. On her it was still, but on Dari it dappled up and down.
'You needn’t to cry,” I said. "Jewel got her out. You needn’t to cry, Dari.”
The bam is still red. It used to be redder than this. Then it went swirling, making the stars run backward
without falling. It hurt my heart like the train did. When 1 went to find where they stay at night, I saw
something that Dewey Dell says I mustnt never feU
nobody.
DARL
"f have been passing the signs for some time
V V now: the drug-stores, the clothing stores, the patent
medicine and the garages and cafes, and the mile-boards
diminishing, becoming more starkly re-accruent: 3 mi. 2
mi. From the crest of a hill, as we get into the wagon
again, we can see the smoke low and flat, seemingly un- moving in the unwinded afternoon.
'Is that it, Dari?” Vardaman says. "Is that Jefferson?'' He too has lost flesh; Kke ours, his face has an expression
strained, dreamy, and gaunt.
"Yes ” I sa)". He lifts his head and looks at the sky. High
against it they hang in nanowing circles, like the smoke,
ivith an outward semblance of form and purpose, but
with no inference of motion, progress or retrograde. We
mount the wagon again where Cash lies on the box,
the jagged shards of cement cracked about his leg. The
shabby mules droop rattling and clanking down the hill. "Well have to take him to the doctor,” pa says. T reckon it ain't no way around it.” The back of Jewels
^hirt, where it touches him, stains slow and black with
grease. Life was created in the valleys. It blew up on to the hills on the old terrors, the old lusts, the old despairs.
That's why you must walk up the hills so you can ride
down.
Dewey Dell sits on the seat, the newspaper package on
her lap. When we reach the foot of the hill where the
road flattens between close walls of trees, she begins to 504
AS I LAY DYING 505
look about quietly from one side of the road to the other. At last she says, got to stop.”
Pa looks at her, his shabby profile that of anticipant
and disgruntled annoyance. He does not chepk the team. ‘What for?”
“I got to go to the bushes,” Dewey Dell says. Pa does not check the team. “Cant you wait til] we get
to town? It ain't over a mile now.”
“Stop,” Dewey Dell says. “I got to go to the bushes."’ Pa stops in the middle of the road and we watch
Dewey Dell descend, carrying the package. She does noi look back.
“Why not leave your cakes here?” I say. “Well watch
them.”
She descends steadily, not looking at us. “How w’'ould she know where to go to if she waited
till we get to town?” Vardaman says. “Where would you
go to do it in town, Dewey DeU?”
She lifts the package down and turns and disappears
among the trees and undergrowth.
“Don’t be no longer than you can help,” pa says. “We
ain’t got no time to waste.” She does not answer. After a while we cannot hear her even. “We ought to done Hke
Armstid and Gillespie said and sent word to town and
had it dug and ready,” he said. “Why didn’t you?” I say. “You could have telephoned.""
“What for?” Jewel says. “Who the hell cant dig a hole
in the ground?”
A car comes over the hill. It begins to sound the hom,
slowing. It runs along the roadside in low gear, the out- side wheels in the ditch, and passes us and goes on. Vardaman
watches it until it is out of sight.

*‘How far is it now, Dari?" he says. "‘Not far," I say. ‘"We ought to done it," pa says. ‘1 just never wanted to be beholden to none except her flesh and blood.”
“Who the hell cant dig a damn hole in the ground?”
Jewel says,
“It ain t respectful, talking that way about her grave,”
pa says. “You all don t know what it is. You never pure
loved her, none of you.” Jewel does not answer. He sits a little stifily erect, his body arched away from his shirt. His high-coloured jaw juts.
Dewey Dell returns. We watch her emerge from the
bushes, carrying the package, and climb into the wagon.
She now wears her Sunday dress, her beads, her shoes
and stockings.
“I thought I told you to leave them clothes to home,”
pa says. She does not answer, does not look at us. She
sits the package in the wagon and gets in. The wagon
moves on. “How many more hills now, Dari?” Vardaman says. “Just one,” I say. “The next one goes right up into
to\vn.”
This hill is red sand, bordered on either hand by negro
cabins; against the sky ahead the massed telephone lines run, and the clock on the court-house lifts among the
trees. In the sand the wheels whisper, as though the very
earth would hush our entry. We descend as the hill com- mences to rise. We follow the wagon, the whispering wheels, passing
the cabins where faces come suddenly to the doors,
white-eyed. We hear sudden voices, ejaculant. Jewel has
been looking from side to side; now his head turns for- ward and I can see his ears taking on a still deeper tone

of furious red. Three negroes walk beside the road ahead
of us; ten feet ahead of them a white man walks. When
we pass the negroes their heads turn suddenly with that expression of shock and instinctive outrage. “Great God,” one says; “what they got in that wagon?”
Jewel whirls. “Son of a bitches,” he says. As he does so he is abreast of the white man, who has paused. It is as though Jewel had gone blind for the moment, for it is the
white man toward whom he whirls. Dari! Cash says from the wagon. I grasp at Tewel. The white man has fallen back a pace, his face still slack- jawed; then his jaw tightens, claps to. Jewel leans above
him, his jaw muscles gone white.
“What did you say?” he says. Here, I say. He don’t mean anything, mister. Jewel,” I say. When I touch b‘m he swings at the man. I grasp his arm; we stmggle. Jewel has never looked at me. He is trying to free his arm. When I see the man again
he has an open knife in his hand.
“Hold up, mister,” I say; “I’ve got him. Jewel,” I say. “Thinks because he’s a goddam town fellow,” Jewel
says, panting, wrenching at me. “Son of a bitch,” he says. The man moves. He begins to edge around me, watching
Jewel, the knife low against his flank. “Can’t no man
call me that,” he says. Pa has got down, and Dewey Dell
is holding Jewel, pushing at him. I release him and face
the man.
“Wait,” I say. “He don’t mean nothing. He’s sick; got
burned in a fire last night, and he ain’t himseh.”
“Fire or no fire,” the man says, “can’t no mao call me
that.” “He thought you said something to him,” I say. T never said nothing to him. I never see him before.

’Fore God,” pa says; ’fore God.”
'1 know,” I say. “He never meant anything. He’ll take
it back.”
“Let liim take it back, then.”
“Put up your knife, and he will.” The man looks at me. He looks at Jewel. Jewel is quiet now.
'Tut up your knife,” I say. The man shuts the knife.
' ’Fore God,” pa says. “’Fore God.”
“Tell him you didn’t mean anything, Jewel ” I say.
“I thought he said something,” Jewel says. “Just because
he’s“Hush,” I say. “Tell him you didn’t mean it.” “I didn’t mean it,” Jewel says. *He better not,” the man says. “Calling me a “Do you think he’s afraid to call you that?” I say. The man looks at me. “I never said that,” he said. “Don’t think it, neither,” Jewel says. “Shut up,” I say. “Come on. Drive on, pa.”
The wagon moves. The man stands watching us. Jewel
does not look back. “Jewel would ’a’ whipped him,” Vardaman
says. We approach the crest, where the street runs, where
cars go back and forth; the mules haul the wagon up
and on to the crest and the street. Pa stops them. The
street runs on ahead, where the square opens and the
monument stands before the court-house. We mount
again while the heads turn with that expression which we
know; save Jewel. He does not get on, even though the
wagon has started again. “Get in, Jewel,” I say. “Come on.
Let’s get away from here.” But he does not get in. Instead
he sets his foot on the turning hub of the rear wheel, one hand grasping the stanchion, and with the hub turning
AS I LAY DYING
smoodily under his sole he lifts the other foot and squats
theie, staring straight ahead, motionless, lean, woodenbacked,
as though carved squatting out of the lean wood.

T WaSN T NOTHING ELSE TO DO. IT WAS EITHER SEND HW
to Jackson, or have Gillespie sue us, because he
knowed some way that Dari set fire to it. I don t know
how he knowed, but he did. Vardaman see him do it, but he swore he never told nobody but Dewey Dell
and that she told him not to tell nobody. But Gillespie
knowed it. But he would 'a’ suspicioned it sooner or later. He could have done it that night just watching the way
Dari acted. And so pa said, “I reckon there ain t nothing else to do,’' and Jewel said, '"You want to fix him now?”
"Fix him?” pa said. "Gatch him and tie him up,” Jewel said. "Goddam it, do you want to wait until he sets fire to the goddam team
and wagon?”
But there wasn’t no use in that. "There ain’t no use in that,” I said. "We can wait till she is underground.” A fel- low that’s going to spend the rest of his life locked up, he
ought to be let to have what pleasure he can have before
he goes.
*T reckon he ought to be there,” pa says. "God knows,

ifs a trial on me. Seems like it ain I no end to bad luck
when once it starts.” Sometimes I ain’t so sho who’s got ere a right to say
when a man is crazy and when he ain’t. Sometimes I think it ain’t none of us pure crazy and ain’t none of us pure sane until the balance of us talks him that-a-way.
It’s like it ain’t so much what a fellow does, but it’s the
way the majority of folks is looking at him when he does
it. Because Jewel is too hard on him. Of course it was
Jewel’s horse was traded to get her that nigh to towm,
and in a sense it was the value of his horse Dari tried to hum up. But I thought more than once before we crossed
the river and after, how it would be God’s blessing if He
did take her outen our hands and get shut of her in some
clean way, and it seemed to me that when Jewel worked
so to get her outen tlie river, he was going against God
in a way, and then when Dan seen that it looked like one
of us would have to do something, I can almost believe
he done right in a way. But I don’t reckon nothing ex- cuses setting fire to a man’s barn and endangering his stock and destroying his property. That’s how I reckon
a man is crazy. That’s how he can’t see eye to eye with
(.)lher folks. And I reckon they ain’t nothing else to do
with him but what the most folks says is right.
But it’s a shame, in a way. Folks seems to get away
from the olden right teaching that says to drive the nails dowm and trim tire edges well always like it was for your
own use and comfort you were making it. It’s like some
foiks has the smooth, pretty boards to build a court-hoxise
with and others don’t have no more than rough lumber
fitten to build a chicken coop. But it’s better to build a
tight chicken coop than a shoddy court-house, and when
they both build shoddy or build well, neither because it’s
AS I LAY DYING JII one or tother is going to make a man feel the better nor
the worse. So we went up the street, toward the square, and he
said, “We better take Cash to the doctor first. We can
leave liim there and come back for him.’" That’s it. It’s because me and him was bom close together, and it nigh ten years before Jewel and Dewey Dell and Vardaman
begun to come along. I feel kin to them, all right,
but I don’t know. And me being the oldest, and thinking
already the very thing that he done: I don’t know.
Pa was looking at me, then at him, mumbling his mouth.
"Go on,” I said. ‘We’ll get it done first.” "She would want us all there,” pa says. "Let’s take Cash to the doctor first,” Dari said. "She’ll wait. She’s already waited nine days.”
"You all don’t know,” pa says. "The somebody you was young with and you growed old in her and she growed
old in you, seeing the old coming on and it was the one somebody you could hear say it don’t matter and know
it was the tmth outen the hard world and all a man’s grief
and trials. You all don’t know.”
‘We got the digging to do, too,” I said. "Armstid and Gillespie both told you to send word
ahead,” Dari said. "Don’t you want to go to Peabody’s now. Cash?”
"Go on,” I said. "It feels right easy now. It’s best to gef
things done in the right place.”
"If it was just dug,” pa says. "We forgot our spade,
too.” "Yes,” Dari said. "I’ll go to the hardware store. We’ll
have to buy one.”
"It’U cost money,” pa says. "Do you begrudge her it?” Dari says.
5^2. AS I LAY DYING
“Go on and get a spade/"^ Jewel said. ''Here, give me
tbe money.”
But pa didn’t stop. “I reckon we can get a spade,” lie said. “I reckon there are Christians here.” So Dari set still and we went on, with Jewel squatting on the tail gate,
watching the back of DarFs head. He looked like one of
these bulldogs, one of these dogs that don’t bark none,
squatting against the rope, watching the thing he was
waiting to jump at. He set that way all the time we was in front of Mrs.
Bundren’s house, hearing the music, watching the back
of Dari’s head with them hard white eyes of hisn. The music was playing in the house. It was one of
them graphophones. It was natural as a music-band.
“Do you want to go to Peabody’s?” Dari said. “They
can wait here and tell pa, and I’ll drive you to Peabody’s
and come back for them.”
“No,” I said. It was better to get her underground, now
we was this close, just waiting until pa borrowed the
shovel. He drove along the street until we could hear the
music.
“Maybe they got one here,” he said. He pulled up at Mrs. Bundren’s. It was like he knowed. Sometimes I think
that a a working man could see work as far ahead as a
lazy man can see laziness. So he stopped there like he
knowed, before that little new house, where the music
was. We waited there, hearing it. I believe I could have
dickered Suratt down to five dollars on that one of his.
It’s a comfortable thing, music is. “Maybe they got one
here,” pa says. “You want Jewel to go,” Dari says, “or do you reckon I better?”
“I reckon I better,” pa says. He got down and went up
AS I LAY DYING JI5
the path and around the house to the back. The music
stopped, tlien it started again.
'"Hell get it, too,’' Dari said,
‘"Ay,” I said. It was just like he knowed, like he could
see through tlie walls and into the next ten minutes.
Only it was more than ten minutes. The music stopped
and never commenced again for a good spell, where her
and pa was talking at the back. We waited in the wagon.
"You let me take you back to Peabody’s,” Dari said. "No,” I said. “Well get her underground.”
“If he ever gets back,” Jewel said. He began to cuss. He
started to get down from the wagon. "Tm going,” he said. Then we saw pa coming back. He had two spades,
coming around the house. He laid them in the wagon
and got in and we went on. The music never started
again. Pa was looking back at the house. He kind of
lifted his hand a little and I saw the shade pulled back a
little at the window and her face in it. But the curiousest thing was Dewey Dell. It surprised me. I see all the while how folks could say he was
queer, but that was the very reason couldn’t nobody hold
it personal. It was hke he was outside of it too, same as you, and getting mad as it would be kind of Hke getting
mad at a mud-puddle that splashed you when you
stepped in it. And then I always kind of had a idea that him and Dewey Dell kind of knowed things betwixt
them. If I’d ’a’ said it was ere a one of us she liked better than ere a other, I’d ’a’ said it was Dari. But when we got
it filled and covered and drove out the gate and turned
into the lane where them fellows was waiting, when they come out and come on him and he jerked back, it was Dewey Dell that was on him before even Jewel could
get at him. And then I believed I knowed how GiUespic
knowed about how his bam taken fire.
5H AS I LAY DYING
She hadn’t said a word, hadn’t even looked at him, but
when tliem fellows told him what they wanted and that
they had come to get him and he throwed back, she
jumped on him like a wild cat so that one of the fellows
had to quit and hold her and her scratching and clawing
at him like a wild cat, while the other one and pa and
Jewel throwed Dari down and held him lying on his back, looking up at me.
"'I thought you would have told me,” he said. “I never
thought you wouldn’t have.”
“Dari,” I said. But he fought again, him and Jewel and
the fellow, and the other one holding Dewey Dell and
Vardaman yelling and Jewel saying,
“Kill him. Kill the son of a bitch.”
It was bad so. It was bad. A fellow can’t get away
from a shoddy job. He can’t do it. I tried to tell him, but
he just said, “I thought you’d ’a’ told me. It’s not that
I,” he said, then he began to laugh. The other fellow
pulled Jewel oflF of him and he sat there on the ground,
laughing.
I tried to tell him. If I could have just moved, even set up. But I tried to tell him and he quit laughing, looking
up at me. “Do you want me to go?” he said.
“It’ll be better for you,” I said. “Down there it’ll be
quiet, with none of the bothering and such. It’U be better
for you, Dari,” I said. “Better,” he said. He began to laugh again. “Better,”
he said. He couldn t hardly say it for laughing. He sat on the ground and us watching him, laughing and laughing.
It was bad. It was bad so. I be durn if I could see anything to laugh at. Because there just ain’t nothing
justifies the deliberate destruction of what a man has
AS I LAY DYING 5^5
built with his own sweat and stored the fruit of his sweat
into. But I ain't so sho that ere a man has the right to say
what is crazy and what ain’t. It's like there was a fellow
in every naan that's done a-past the sanity or the insanity,
that watches the sane and the insane doings of that man
with the same horror and the same astonisliment.

“Hit was gittin’ right noticeable," he said. “We never had time to wait." I just looked at him. “Hit never bothered

it never bothered you.”
“I never bothered me much," he said. “You mean, it never bothered Anse much," I said. “No more than it bothered him to throw that poor devil down

“He's takin back them spades he borrowed,” he said. “That's right,” I said. “Of course he'd have to borrow a spade to bury his wife with. Unless he could borrow^ a hole in the ground. Too bad you all didn't put him in

“Not to speak of,” he said, and the sweat big as marbles running down his face and his face about the
colour of blotting-paper,
“Course not ” I said. “About next summer you can

T HAPPENED I AM BACK OF THE PRESCRIPTION CASE, POXJR- ing up some chocolate sauce, when Jody comes back
and says, Say, Sheet, there’s a woman up front that wants to see the doctor and when I said What doctor
you want to see, she said she want to see the doctor that works here and when I said There ain’t any doctor works
here, she just stood there, looking back this way.”
'‘What kind of a woman is it?” I says. "Tell her to go
upstairs to Alford’s office.” "Country woman,” he says. "Send her to the court-house,” I says. "Tell her all the
doctors have gone to Memphis to a Barbers’ Convention.”
"All right,” he says, going away. "She looks pretty
good for a country girl,” he says. "Wait,” I says. He waited and I went and peeped
through the crack. But I couldn’t tell nothing except she
had a good leg against the light. "Is she young, you say?”
I says.
"Sh() looks like a pretty hot mamma, for a country
girl,” he says. "Take this,” I says, giving him the chocolate. I took
oS my apron and went up there. She looked pretty good.
One of them black-eyed ones that look like she’d as soon put a knife in you as not if you two-timed her. She
looked pretty good. There wasn’t nobody else in the
store; it was dinner-time.
'What can I do for you?” I says. 517
5I8 as I LAY DYING
"Are you the doctor?” she says. "Sure/’ I says. She quit looldng at me and was kind of looking around.
"Can we go back yonder?” she says.
It was just a quarter-past twelve, but I went and told
Jody to kind of watch out and whistle if the old man
come in sight, because he never got back before one.
‘"You better lay off of that,” Jody says. "Hell fire your
stern out of here so quick you can’t wink.”
"He don’t never get back before one,” I says. "You
can see him go into the post-office. You keep your eye
peeled, now, and give me a whistle.”
"What you going to do?” he says. "You keep your eye out. Ill tell you later.” "Ain’t you going to give me no seconds on it?” he says. "What the hell do you think this is?” I says; "a studfarm?
You watch out for him. I’m going into conference.”
So I go on to the back. I stopped at the glass and
smoothed my hair, then I went behind the prescription
case, where she was waiting. She is looking at the medicine
cabinet, tlien she looks at me. "Now, madam,” I says; "what is your trouble?”
"It’s the female trouble,” she says, watching me. "I got
the money,” she says. "Ah,” I says. "Have you got female troubles or do
you want female troubles? If so, you come to the right doctor.” Them country people. Half the time they don’t
know what they want, and the balance of the time they
can’t tell it to you. The clock said twenty past twelve.
"No,” she says. "No which?” I says.
"I ain’t had it,” she says. "That’s it.” She looked at me.
"I got the money,” she says.
AS I LAY DYING 5^9
So I knew what she was talking about.
‘"Oh," I says. 'Ton got something in your belly you
wish you didn’t have.” She looks at me. "Tou wish you
had a httle more or a little less, huh?”
‘Tl got the money,” she says. "He said I could git
something at the drug-store for hit.” "Who said so?” I says. "He did,” she says, looking at me. "You don’t want to call no names,” I says. "The one
that put the acorn in your belly? He the one that told you?” She don’t say nothing, "You ain’t married, are you?” I says. I never saw no ring. But like as not, they
ain’t heard yet out there that they use rings.
"I got the money,” she says. She showed it to me, tied up in her handkerchief: a ten spot.
"I’ll swear you have,” I says. "He give it to you?”
‘Y'es,” she says. "Which one?” I says. She looks at me. 'Which one of them give it to you?”
"It ain’t but one,” she says. She looks at me. "Go on,” I says. She don’t say nothing. The trouble
about the cellar is, it ain’t but one way out and that’s back up the inside stairs. The clock says twenty-five to one. "A pretty girl like you,” I says. She looks at me. She begins to tie the money back up
in the handkerchief. "Excuse me a minute,” I says. I go
around the prescription case. "Did you hear about that fellow sprained his ear?” I says. "After that he couldn’t even hear a belch.”
"You better get her out from back there before the
old man comes,” Jody says. "If you’ll stay up there in front where he pays you to
stay, he won’t catch nobody but me,” I says.
520 AS I LAY LYING
He goes on, slow, toward the front. 'What you doing
to her, Sheet?” he says. "I cant tell you,” I says. "It wouldn’t be ethical. You
go on up there and watch.”
"Say, Sheet,” he says. "Ah, go on,” I says. "I ain’t doing nothing but filling a prescription.”
"He may not do nothing about that woman back there,
but if he finds you monkeying with that prescription case,
he’ll kick your stern clean down them cellar stairs.” "My stern has been kicked by bigger bastards tlian him,” I says. "Go back and watch out for him, now.”
So I come back. The clock said fifteen to one. She is tying the money in the handkerchief. Wou ain’t the
doctor,” she says. "Sure I am,” I says. She watches me. "Is it because I look too young, or am I too handsome?” I says. "We
used to have a bunch of old water-jointed doctors here,”
I says; "Jefferson used to be a kind of Old Doctors’ Home
for tliem. But business started falling off and folks stayed
so well until one day they found out that the women
wouldn’t never get sick at all. So they run all the old
doctors out and got us young good-looking ones that the women would like and then the women begun to get sick again and so business picked up. They’re doing
that all over the country. Hadn’t you heard about it? Maybe it’s because you ain’t never needed a doctor.”
"I need one now,” she says. "And you come to the right one,” I says. "I already
told you that.” "Have you got something for it?” she says. "I got the
money.”
"Well,” I says, "of course a doctor has to learn all sorts
AS I LAY DYING 521
of things while he's learning to roll calomel; he cant
help himself. But I don't know about your trouble." "He told me I could get something. He told me I could
get it at the drug-store."
"Did he tell you the name of it?" I says. "You better go back and ask him."
She quit looking at me, kind of turning the handker
chief in her hands. "I got to do something," she says. "How bad do you want to do something?" I says. She
looks at me. “Of course, a doctor learns all sorts of things
folks don't think he knows. But he ain't supposed to tell
all he knows. It's against the law."
Up front Jody says, “Skeet.” “Excuse me a minute,” I says. I went up front. “Do
you see him?" I says, “Ain't you done yet?" he says. “Maybe you better come
up here and watch and let me do that consulting.”
“Maybe you’ll lay a egg," I says. I come back. She is looking at me. “Of course you realize that I could be put
in the penitentiary for doing what you want," I says. “I would lose my licence and then I'd have to go to work.
You realize that?"
“I ain't got but ten dollars," she says. “I could bring
the rest next month, maybe."
“Pooh,” I says, “ten dollars? You see, I can't put no
price on my knowledge and skill. Certainly not for no
little paltry sawbuck."
She looks at me. She don't even blink. “What you want,
then?”
The clock said four to one. So I decided I better get
her out. “You guess three times and then I'll show you,"
I says. She don't even blink her eyes. “I got to do something,"
522 AS I LAY DYING
she says. She looks behind her and around, then she
looks toward the front. ^"Ginime the medicine fii'st/" she
says. '"You mean, you re ready to right now?” I says. “Here?"’ '"Gimme the medicine first,” she says. So I took a graduated glass and kind of turned my
back to her and picked out a bottle that looked all right,
because a man that would keep poison setting around
in a unlabelled bottle ought to be in jail, anyway. It smelled like turpentine. I poured some into the glass
and give it to her. She smelled it, looking at me across the glass.
"Hit smells like turpentine,” she says. "Sure,” I says. "That’s just the beginning of the treat- ment. You come back at ten o’clock to-night and 111 give
you the rest of it and perform the operation.”
"Operation?” she says.
"It wont hurt you. You’ve had the same operation
before. Ever hear about the hair of the dog?”
She looks at me. “Will it work?” she says. "Sure it’ll work. If you come back and get it”
So she drunk whatever it was without batting a eye, and went out. I went up front. "Didn’t you get it?” Jody says. "Get what?” I says. "Ah, come on,” he says, "I ain’t going to try to beat
your time.”
"Oh, her,” I says. “She just wanted a little medicine.
She’s got a bad case of dysentery and she’s a little ashamed about mentioning it with a stranger there.”
It was my night, anyway, so I helped the old bastard
check up and I got his hat on him and got him out of the store by eight-tliirty. I went as far as corner with
him and watched him until he passed under two street
AS I LAY DYING 523
lamps and went on out of sight. Then I come back to the
store and waited until nine-thirty and turned out tlie front lights and locked the door and left just one light
burning at tire back, and I went back and put some tal- cum powder into sLx capsules and kind of cleared up the
cellar and then I was all ready.
She come in just at ten, before the clock had done
striking. I let her in and she come in, walking fast. I looked out the door, but there wasn’t nobody but a boy
in overalls sitting on the curb. “You want something?” I
says. He never said nothing, just looking at me. I locked
the door and turned off the hght and went on back. She was waiting. She didn’t look at me now. “Where is it?” she said.
I gave her the box of capsules. She held the box in her hand, looking at the capsules.
“Are you sure it’ll work?” she says.
“Sure,'’ I says. ‘When you take the rest of the treab
nrent.” “Where do I take it?” she says. “Down in tlie cellar,” I says. YARD AM AN

They xoost in the trees, but the court-house is dark. The

Dari went to Jackson. Lots of people didnt go to Jackson.

men could not drink them. Two mules could not. Two
cows could not. Dari
A man comes to the door. He looks at Dewey Dell. “You wait out here,” Dewey Dell says. “Why can 1 1 come in?” I say. “I want to come in, too.”
- “You wait out here,” she says. “All right,” I say. Dewey Dell goes in. Dari is my brother. Dari went crazy
The walk is harder than sitting on the ground. He is in the open door. He looks at me. “You want something?”
he says. His head is slick. Jewels head is slick sometimes.
AS I LAY DYING 5^5
Cash's head is not slick. Dari he went to Jackson my
Brother Dari In the street he ate a banana. WouldnH you
rather have bananas? Dewey Dell said. You wait till Christmas. Ifll be there then. Then you can see it. So we
are going to have some bananas. We are going to have a bag full, me and Dewey Dell. He locks the door. Dewey
Dell is inside. Then the light winks out. He went to Jackson. He went crazy and went to Jack- son both. Lots of people didnt go crazy. Pa and Cash
and Jewel and Dewey Dell and me didnt go crazy. We
never did go crazy. We didn’t go to Jackson either. Dari
I hear the cow a long time, clopping on the street. Then she comes into the square. She goes across the
square, her head down clopping . She lows. There was nothing in the square before she lowed, but it wasn't
empty. Now it is empty after she lowed. She goes on, clopping . She lows. My brother is Dari. He went to Jackson on the train. He didn’t go on the train to go crazy. He went crazy in our wagon. Dari She had been in there a long time. And the cow is gone too. A long time. She
has been in there longer tlian the cow was. But not as long as empty. Dari is my brother. My brother Dari
Dewey Dell comes out. She looks at me.
"Xet s go around that way now," I say. She looks at me. 'Tt ain't going to work," she says. '‘That son of a bitch." “What ain't going to work, Dewey Dell?"
‘T just know it won't," she says. She is not looking at anything, ‘1 just know it." “Let's go that way," I say. ‘We got to go back to the hotel. It's late. We got to
slip back in.” “Can't we go by and see, anyway?"
5^6 AS I LAY DYING
“Hadn’t you ratiier have bananas? Hadn’t you rather?”
“All right.” My brother he went crazy and he went to Jacksm% too, Jackson is further away than crazy
“It won’t work,” Dewey Dell says. “I just know it won’t.” "What won’t work?” I say. He had to get on the train
to go to Jackson. I ham not been on the train, but Dari
has been an the train. Dari. Dari is my brother. Dari.
Dari
DARL
D
ARL has gone to JACKSON. THEY PUT HIM ON THE
train, laughing, dov^na the long car laughing, the
heads turning like the heads of owls when he passed.
What are you laughing at?” I said. "Tes yes yes yes yes.”
Two men put him on the train. They wore mismatched
coats, bulging behind over their right hip
pockets. Their necks were shaved to a hairline, as though
the recent and simultaneous barbers had had a chalkline
like Cash’s. “Is it the pistols you’re laughing at?” I said. "Why do you laugh?” I said. “Is it because you hate
the sound of laughing?”
They pulled two seats together so Dari could sit by
the window to laugh. One of them sat beside him, the
other sat on the seat facing him, riding backward. One
of them had to ride backward because the state’s money
AS I LAY DYING 5V
had a face to each backside and a backside to each face,
and they are riding on tlie state's money which is incest. A nickel has a woman on one side and a buffalo on the
other; two faces and no back. I don't know what that is. Dari had a little spy-glass he got in France at the war.
In it it had a woman and a pig with two backs and no
face. I know what that is. ‘Is that why you are laughing,
Dari?'-
'"Yes yes yes yes yes yes."
The wagon stands on the square, hitched, the mules
motionless, the reins wrapped about the seat-spring, the
back of the wagon toward the coinrt-house. It looks no
different from a hundred other wagons there; Jewel
standing beside it and looking up the street like any
other man in town that day, yet tliere is something dif- ferent, distinctive. There is about it that unmistakable
air of definite and imminent departure that trains have,
perhaps due to tlie fact that Dewey Dell and Vardaman
on the seat and Cash on a pallet in the wagon bed are eating bananas from a paper bag. 'Ts that why you are laughing, Dari?"
Dari is our brotlier, our brother Dari. Our brother
Dari in a cage in Jackson where, his grimed hands lying
light in the quiet interstices, looking out he foams.
'Tes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes."
DEWEY DELL
WHEN HE SAW THE MONEY I SAID, "tt’s NOT MY
money, it doesn't belong to me.”
‘Whose is it, then?”
“It s Cora TulFs money. It's Mrs. Tull's. I sold the cakes
for it.” “Ten dollars for two cakes?”
“Don't you touch it. It's not mine.”
“You never had them cakes. It's a lie. It was them
Sunday clothes you had in that package.”
“Don't you touch iti If you take it you are a thief.” “My own daughter accuses me of being a thief. My
jwTi daughter.”
“Pa. Pa.”
“I have fed you and sheltered you. I give you love ana
care, yet my own daughter, the daughter of my dead
wife, calls me a thief over her mother's grave.”
“It's not mine, I tell you. If it was, God knows you
could have it.” “Where did you get ten dollars?” “Pa. Pa.”
“You won't tell me. Did you come by it so shameful
you dare not?”
“It's not mine, I tell you. Can't you understand it's not
mine?”
“It's not like I wouldn't pay it back. But she calls her own father a thief.” “I can't, I tell you. I tell you it's not my money. God
knows you could have it.” ^28
AS I LAY DYING ^25
I wouldnt take it. My own born daughter that has el my food for seventeen years, begrudges me the loan of ten dollars.
“It s not mine. I can’t.” ‘'Whose is it, then?”
“It was give to me. To buy something; with.”
“To buy what with?”
“Pa. Pa.”
“It s just a loan. God knows, I hate for my blooden
children to reproach me. But I give them what was mine
without stint. Cheerful I give them, without stint. And
now they deny me. Addie. It was luckv for you you died,
Addie.”
' ’ ‘Ta. Pa.”
“God knows it is.” He took the money and went out. CASH
^O WHEN WE STOPPED THEEE TO BOKROW THE SHOVELS 0 we heard the graphophone playing m the house, and
so when we got done with the shovels pa says, “I reckon
1 better take them back.”
So we went back to the house. ‘We better take Cash
on to Peabody’s,” Jewel said.
“It won’t take but a minute,” pa said. He got down
from the wagon. The music was not playing now.
530 AS i LAY DYING
'Xet Vardaman do it/" Jewel said. “He can do it in
haM the time you can. Or here, you let me
“I reckon I better do it” pa says. “Long as it was me
that borrowed them.”
So we set in the wagon, but the music wasn t playing now. I reckon it’s a good thing we ain t got ere a one
of them. I reckon I wouldn’t never get no work done
a-tall for listening to it. I don’t know if a little music
ain’t about the nicest thing a fellow can have. Seems like when he comes in tired of a night, it ain’t nothing could
rest him like having a Httle music played and him rest- ing. I have seen them that shuts up like a hand-grip,
with a handle and all, so a fellow can carry it with him
wherever he wants. “What you reckon he’s doing?” Jewel says. “I could a
toted them shovels back and forth ten times by now.”
“Let him take his time,” I said. “He ain’t as spry as you,
remember.”
‘Why didn’t he let me take them back, then? We got
to get your leg fixed up so we can start home tomorrow.”
“We got plenty of time,” I said. “I wonder what them
machines costs on the instalment.”
“Instalment of what?” Jewel said. “What you got to buy it with?”
“A fellow can’t tell,” I said. “I could ’a’ bought that one from Suratt for five dollars, I believe.” And so pa come back and we went to Peabody’s,
While we was there pa said he was going to the barbershop
and get a shave. And so that night he said he had some business to tend to, kind of looking away from us while he said it, with his hair combed wet and slick and
smelling sweet with perfume, but I said leave him be:
I wouldn’t mind hearing a little more of that music myself.
AS I LAY DYING 531
And so next morning he was gone again, then he come back and told us get hitched up and ready to take out and he would meet us and when they was gone he
said, '1 don t reckon you got no more money/'
'Teabody just give me enough to pay the hotel with/'
I said. 'yVe don't need notliing else, do we?"
"No," pa said; "no. We don't need nothing." He stood
there, not looking at me.
"If it is something we got to have, I reckon maybe
Peabody," I said. "No," he said; "it ain't nothing else. You all wait foi me at the corner." So Jewel got the team and come for me and they fixed me a pallet in the wagon and we drove across the square
to tire corner where Pa said, and we was waiting there in the wagon, with Dewey Dell and Vardaman eating
bananas, when we see them coming up the street. Pa was coming along with that kind of daresome and hangdog
look all at once like when he has been up to something
he knows ma ain't* goiiig to like, carrying a grip in his hand, and Jewel says, ‘Who's that?"
Then we see it wasn't the grip that made hfm look dif- ferent; it was his face, and ^ Jewel sa;fs, "He got them
teeth."
It was a fact. It made him look a foot taller, kind of holding his head up, hangdog and proud too, and then
we see her behind him, carrying the other grip—a kind
of duck-shaped woman all dressed up, with tiaem kind of hard-looking pop eyes like she was daring ere a man to say nothing. And there we set watching them, with
Dewey Dell's and Vardaman’s mouth half open and
half-et bananas in their hands and her coming around
532 AS I LAY DYING
from behind pa, looking at us like she dared ere a man. And tlien I see that the grip she was canying was one of
fJiem little graphcphones. It was for a fact, all shut up as pretty as a picture, and every time a new record would come from the mail order and us setting in the house
in the winter, listening to it, I would think what a shame
Dari couldn’t be to enjoy it too. But it is better so for him. This world is not his world; this life his life. "Tt’s Cash and Jewel and Vardaman and Dewey Dell,”
pa says, kind of hangdog and proud too, with his teeth
and all, even if he wouldn’t look at us. “Meet MrSc
Bundrer,” he says.
